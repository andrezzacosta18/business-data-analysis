# Retail Profit Optimization & Margin Risk Analysis

## Objective

This project simulates a real-world retail scenario where sales data is analyzed to support strategic decision-making, identify structural profitability risks, and optimize financial performance.

The primary objective is to demonstrate how data analysis can move beyond revenue tracking and focus on sustainable margin optimization.

## Business Context

The dataset represents a multi-category retail company operating across multiple U.S. regions.

Although the company generates over $2.3M in revenue, the central question is:

**Is this growth financially sustainable?**

The strategic focus of this analysis is profitability diagnostics and margin risk detection.
