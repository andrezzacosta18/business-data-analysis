# Business Analysis Brief

## 1. Company Overview

This dataset represents a multi-category retail company operating in the United States between 2014 and 2017.

The company generates revenue through transactional product sales across three main categories:

- Furniture  
- Office Supplies  
- Technology  

It serves three primary customer segments:

- Consumer  
- Corporate  
- Home Office  

Each row in the dataset represents a product sold within a customer order, meaning revenue and profit are calculated at item level.

The company generated approximately $2.29M in revenue during the analyzed period, with an overall profit margin of ~12.5%.

## 2. Business Model Assumptions

Based on the dataset structure, the following assumptions are made:

- Revenue is generated through product-level transactions.
- Profit is influenced by pricing strategy, cost structure, and discount intensity.
- Discounting is used as a commercial lever but may impact profitability.
- Margin performance may vary by category, region, and customer segment.
- Certain products may generate revenue but erode profit.
- Financial risk may exist even in high-revenue environments.

## 3. Stakeholder Perspective (CFO Directive)

The primary stakeholder for this analysis is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

Main concern:

Despite generating over $2.29M in revenue, the company operates at a relatively modest margin (~12.5%).

The CFO requires a structured margin risk diagnosis to determine:

- Where profit is being eroded
- Whether discounting strategy is sustainable
- Which categories or products underperform financially
- Whether structural margin imbalance exists
- How profitability can be improved without increasing revenue volume

The analysis must support margin optimization decisions.

## 4. Core Business Questions (Profit-Focused)

1. Which categories have the highest and lowest profit margins?
2. Are there sub-categories systematically underperforming?
3. Does discount intensity negatively impact profit?
4. Are there products generating high revenue but low or negative margins?
5. Are certain regions structurally less profitable?
6. What would be the financial impact of increasing overall margin by 2–3 percentage points?

---

## 5. Key Metrics to Evaluate

Financial KPIs:

- Total Revenue
- Total Profit
- Overall Profit Margin
- Profit Margin by Category
- Profit Margin by Sub-Category
- Profit Margin by Region
- Discount vs Profit Relationship
- Product-Level Margin
- High Revenue / Low Margin Risk Indicators

---

## 6. Initial Hypotheses (Margin Diagnosis)

1. High discount levels significantly reduce profitability.
2. Some high-revenue categories operate with structurally lower margins.
3. A subset of products generates revenue but weakens financial performance.
4. Margin performance varies significantly across regions.
5. Small margin improvements could generate disproportionately higher profit.

---

## 7. Analytical Plan (Margin Optimization Framework)

1. Data understanding and validation
2. Data cleaning and structuring
3. Overall margin calculation
4. Margin by category and sub-category
5. Discount sensitivity analysis
6. Product-level risk identification
7. Regional margin comparison
8. Financial scenario simulation (margin improvement impact)
9. Executive recommendations

## Strategic Focus: Profit Optimization

The objective is to diagnose structural margin erosion and identify financial optimization levers.

This analysis does not prioritize revenue growth.

Instead, it focuses on:

- Increasing profitability efficiency
- Reducing margin leakage
- Improving pricing governance
- Identifying financially risky products
- Supporting sustainable financial growth

The final outcome should provide actionable recommendations to improve overall margin without increasing sales volume.
