    See `Sources for Time Zone and Daylight Saving Time Data
    <https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html>`_ for more information.
    Time zone files can be compiled from the `IANA Time Zone database files
    <https://www.iana.org/time-zones>`_ with the `zic time zone compiler
    <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=zic&sektion=8>`_

    .. note::

        Only construct a ``tzfile`` directly if you have a specific timezone
        file on disk that you want to read into a Python ``tzinfo`` object.
        If you want to get a ``tzfile`` representing a specific IANA zone,
        (e.g. ``\'America/New_York\'``), you should call
        :func:`dateutil.tz.gettz` with the zone identifier.


    **Examples:**

    Using the US Eastern time zone as an example, we can see that a ``tzfile``
    provides time zone information for the standard Daylight Saving offsets:

    .. testsetup:: tzfile

        from dateutil.tz import gettz
        from datetime import datetime

    .. doctest:: tzfile

        >>> NYC = gettz(\'America/New_York\')
        >>> NYC
        tzfile(\'/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York\')

        >>> print(datetime(2016, 1, 3, tzinfo=NYC))     # EST
        2016-01-03 00:00:00-05:00

        >>> print(datetime(2016, 7, 7, tzinfo=NYC))     # EDT
        2016-07-07 00:00:00-04:00


    The ``tzfile`` structure contains a fully history of the time zone,
    so historical dates will also have the right offsets. For example, before
    the adoption of the UTC standards, New York used local solar  mean time:

    .. doctest:: tzfile

       >>> print(datetime(1901, 4, 12, tzinfo=NYC))    # LMT
       1901-04-12 00:00:00-04:56

    And during World War II, New York was on "Eastern War Time", which was a
    state of permanent daylight saving time:

    .. doctest:: tzfile

        >>> print(datetime(1944, 2, 7, tzinfo=NYC))    # EWT
        1944-02-07 00:00:00-04:00

    The ``tzrange`` object is a time zone specified by a set of offsets and

    in POSIX-like systems, but using Python delta objects to specify DST
    start, end and offsets.

    :param stdabbr:
        The abbreviation for standard time (e.g. ``\'EST\'``).

    :param stdoffset:
        An integer or :class:`datetime.timedelta` object or equivalent
        specifying the base offset from UTC.

        If unspecified, +00:00 is used.

    :param dstabbr:
        The abbreviation for DST / "Summer" time (e.g. ``\'EDT\'``).

        If specified, with no other DST information, DST is assumed to occur
        and the default behavior or ``dstoffset``, ``start`` and ``end`` is
        used. If unspecified and no other DST information is specified, it
        is assumed that this zone has no DST.

        If this is unspecified and other DST information is *is* specified,
        DST occurs in the zone but the time zone abbreviation is left
        unchanged.

    :param dstoffset:
        A an integer or :class:`datetime.timedelta` object or equivalent
        specifying the UTC offset during DST. If unspecified and any other DST
        information is specified, it is assumed to be the STD offset +1 hour.

    :param start:
        A :class:`relativedelta.relativedelta` object or equivalent specifying
        the time and time of year that daylight savings time starts. To
        specify, for example, that DST starts at 2AM on the 2nd Sunday in
        March, pass:

            ``relativedelta(hours=2, month=3, day=1, weekday=SU(+2))``

        If unspecified and any other DST information is specified, the default
        value is 2 AM on the first Sunday in April.

    :param end:
        A :class:`relativedelta.relativedelta` object or equivalent
        representing the time and time of year that daylight savings time
        ends, with the same specification method as in ``start``. One note is
        that this should point to the first time in the *standard* zone, so if
        a transition occurs at 2AM in the DST zone and the clocks are set back
        1 hour to 1AM, set the ``hours`` parameter to +1.

    behavior, pass a ``True`` value to ``posix_offset``.
