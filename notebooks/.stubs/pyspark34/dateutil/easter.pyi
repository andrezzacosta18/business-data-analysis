    This method was ported from the work done by GM Arts,
    on top of the algorithm by Claus Tondering, which was
    based in part on the algorithm of Ouding (1940), as
    quoted in "Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical
    Almanac", P.  Kenneth Seidelmann, editor.

    This algorithm implements three different Easter
    calculation methods:

    1. Original calculation in Julian calendar, valid in
       dates after 326 AD
    2. Original method, with date converted to Gregorian
       calendar, valid in years 1583 to 4099
    3. Revised method, in Gregorian calendar, valid in
       years 1583 to 4099 as well

    These methods are represented by the constants:

    * ``EASTER_JULIAN   = 1``
    * ``EASTER_ORTHODOX = 2``
    * ``EASTER_WESTERN  = 3``

    The default method is method 3.
