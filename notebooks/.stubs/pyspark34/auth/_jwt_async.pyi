class Credentials(jwt.Credentials, _credentials_async.Signing, _credentials_async.Credentials):
    '''Credentials that use a JWT as the bearer token.

    These credentials require an "audience" claim. This claim identifies the
    intended recipient of the bearer token.

    The constructor arguments determine the claims for the JWT that is
    sent with requests. Usually, you\'ll construct these credentials with
    one of the helper constructors as shown in the next section.

    To create JWT credentials using a Google service account private key
    JSON file::

        audience = \'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/google.pubsub.v1.Publisher\'
        credentials = jwt_async.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            \'service-account.json\',
            audience=audience)

    If you already have the service account file loaded and parsed::

        service_account_info = json.load(open(\'service_account.json\'))
        credentials = jwt_async.Credentials.from_service_account_info(
            service_account_info,
            audience=audience)

    Both helper methods pass on arguments to the constructor, so you can
    specify the JWT claims::

        credentials = jwt_async.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            \'service-account.json\',
            audience=audience,
            additional_claims={\'meta\': \'data\'})

    You can also construct the credentials directly if you have a
    :class:`~google.auth.crypt.Signer` instance::

        credentials = jwt_async.Credentials(
            signer,
            issuer=\'your-issuer\',
            subject=\'your-subject\',
            audience=audience)

    The claims are considered immutable. If you want to modify the claims,
    you can easily create another instance using :meth:`with_claims`::

        new_audience = (
            \'https://pubsub.googleapis.com/google.pubsub.v1.Subscriber\')
        new_credentials = credentials.with_claims(audience=new_audience)
    '''
class OnDemandCredentials(jwt.OnDemandCredentials, _credentials_async.Signing, _credentials_async.Credentials):
    """On-demand JWT credentials.

    Like :class:`Credentials`, this class uses a JWT as the bearer token for
    authentication. However, this class does not require the audience at
    construction time. Instead, it will generate a new token on-demand for
    each request using the request URI as the audience. It caches tokens
    so that multiple requests to the same URI do not incur the overhead
    of generating a new token every time.

    This behavior is especially useful for `gRPC`_ clients. A gRPC service may
    have multiple audience and gRPC clients may not know all of the audiences
    required for accessing a particular service. With these credentials,
    no knowledge of the audiences is required ahead of time.
