    The returned list of integers should add up to total in most cases, unless it is
    impossible to satisfy all the constraints. For instance, if there are two edges
    with a minimum size of 20 each and `total` is 30 then the returned list will be
    greater than total. In practice, this would mean that a Layout object would
    clip the rows that would overflow the screen height.
