    A Naive Bayes classifier.  Naive Bayes classifiers are
    paramaterized by two probability distributions:

      - P(label) gives the probability that an input will receive each
        label, given no information about the input's features.

      - P(fname=fval|label) gives the probability that a given feature
        (fname) will receive a given value (fval), given that the
        label (label).

    If the classifier encounters an input with a feature that has
    never been seen with any label, then rather than assigning a
    probability of 0 to all labels, it will ignore that feature.

    The feature value 'None' is reserved for unseen feature values;
    you generally should not use 'None' as a feature value for one of
    your own features.
