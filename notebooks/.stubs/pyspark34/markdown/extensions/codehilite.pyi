class CodeHilite:
    '''
    Determine language of source code, and pass it on to the Pygments highlighter.

    Usage:
        code = CodeHilite(src=some_code, lang=\'python\')
        html = code.hilite()

    Arguments:
    * `src`: Source string or any object with a `.readline` attribute.

    * `lang`: String name of Pygments lexer to use for highlighting. Default: `None`.

    * `guess_lang`: Auto-detect which lexer to use. Ignored if `lang` is set to a valid
      value. Default: `True`.

    * `use_pygments`: Pass code to Pygments for code highlighting. If `False`, the code is
      instead wrapped for highlighting by a JavaScript library. Default: `True`.

    * `pygments_formatter`: The name of a Pygments formatter or a formatter class used for
      highlighting the code blocks. Default: `html`.

    * `linenums`: An alias to Pygments `linenos` formatter option. Default: `None`.

    * `css_class`: An alias to Pygments `cssclass` formatter option. Default: \'codehilite\'.

    * `lang_prefix`: Prefix prepended to the language. Default: "language-".

    Other Options:
    Any other options are accepted and passed on to the lexer and formatter. Therefore,
    valid options include any options which are accepted by the `html` formatter or
    whichever lexer the code\'s language uses. Note that most lexers do not have any
    options. However, a few have very useful options, such as PHP\'s `startinline` option.
    Any invalid options are ignored without error.

    Formatter options: https://pygments.org/docs/formatters/#HtmlFormatter
    Lexer Options: https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/

    Additionally, when Pygments is enabled, the code\'s language is passed to the
    formatter as an extra option `lang_str`, whose value being `{lang_prefix}{lang}`.
    This option has no effect to the Pygments\' builtin formatters.

    Advanced Usage:
        code = CodeHilite(
            src = some_code,
            lang = \'php\',
            startinline = True,      # Lexer option. Snippet does not start with `<?php`.
            linenostart = 42,        # Formatter option. Snippet starts on line 42.
            hl_lines = [45, 49, 50], # Formatter option. Highlight lines 45, 49, and 50.
            linenos = \'inline\'       # Formatter option. Avoid alignment problems.
        )
        html = code.hilite()
