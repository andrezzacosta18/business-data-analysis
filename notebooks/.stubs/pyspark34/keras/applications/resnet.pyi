    '''Instantiates the ResNet, ResNetV2, and ResNeXt architecture.

    Args:
      stack_fn: a function that returns output tensor for the
        stacked residual blocks.
      preact: whether to use pre-activation or not
        (True for ResNetV2, False for ResNet and ResNeXt).
      use_bias: whether to use biases for convolutional layers or not
        (True for ResNet and ResNetV2, False for ResNeXt).
      model_name: string, model name.
      include_top: whether to include the fully-connected
        layer at the top of the network.
      weights: one of `None` (random initialization),
        \'imagenet\' (pre-training on ImageNet),
        or the path to the weights file to be loaded.
      input_tensor: optional Keras tensor
        (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`)
        to use as image input for the model.
      input_shape: optional shape tuple, only to be specified
        if `include_top` is False (otherwise the input shape
        has to be `(224, 224, 3)` (with `channels_last` data format)
        or `(3, 224, 224)` (with `channels_first` data format).
        It should have exactly 3 inputs channels.
      pooling: optional pooling mode for feature extraction
        when `include_top` is `False`.
        - `None` means that the output of the model will be
            the 4D tensor output of the
            last convolutional layer.
        - `avg` means that global average pooling
            will be applied to the output of the
            last convolutional layer, and thus
            the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
        - `max` means that global max pooling will
            be applied.
      classes: optional number of classes to classify images
        into, only to be specified if `include_top` is True, and
        if no `weights` argument is specified.
      classifier_activation: A `str` or callable. The activation function to use
        on the "top" layer. Ignored unless `include_top=True`. Set
        `classifier_activation=None` to return the logits of the "top" layer.
        When loading pretrained weights, `classifier_activation` can only
        be `None` or `"softmax"`.
      **kwargs: For backwards compatibility only.

    Returns:
      A `keras.Model` instance.
