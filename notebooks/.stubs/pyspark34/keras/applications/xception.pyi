    Reference:
    - [Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions](
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357) (CVPR 2017)

    For image classification use cases, see
    [this page for detailed examples](
      https://keras.io/api/applications/#usage-examples-for-image-classification-models).

    For transfer learning use cases, make sure to read the
    [guide to transfer learning & fine-tuning](
      https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/).

    The default input image size for this model is 299x299.

    Note: each Keras Application expects a specific kind of input preprocessing.
    For Xception, call `tf.keras.applications.xception.preprocess_input` on your
    inputs before passing them to the model.
    `xception.preprocess_input` will scale input pixels between -1 and 1.

    Args:
      include_top: whether to include the fully-connected
        layer at the top of the network.
      weights: one of `None` (random initialization),
        \'imagenet\' (pre-training on ImageNet),
        or the path to the weights file to be loaded.
      input_tensor: optional Keras tensor
        (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`)
        to use as image input for the model.
      input_shape: optional shape tuple, only to be specified
        if `include_top` is False (otherwise the input shape
        has to be `(299, 299, 3)`.
        It should have exactly 3 inputs channels,
        and width and height should be no smaller than 71.
        E.g. `(150, 150, 3)` would be one valid value.
      pooling: Optional pooling mode for feature extraction
        when `include_top` is `False`.
        - `None` means that the output of the model will be
            the 4D tensor output of the
            last convolutional block.
        - `avg` means that global average pooling
            will be applied to the output of the
            last convolutional block, and thus
            the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
        - `max` means that global max pooling will
            be applied.
      classes: optional number of classes to classify images
        into, only to be specified if `include_top` is True,
        and if no `weights` argument is specified.
      classifier_activation: A `str` or callable. The activation function to use
        on the "top" layer. Ignored unless `include_top=True`. Set
        `classifier_activation=None` to return the logits of the "top" layer.
        When loading pretrained weights, `classifier_activation` can only
        be `None` or `"softmax"`.

    Returns:
      A `keras.Model` instance.
