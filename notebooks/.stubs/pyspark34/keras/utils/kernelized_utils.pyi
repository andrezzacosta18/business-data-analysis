    """Computes exact Gaussian kernel value(s) for tensors x and y and stddev.

    The Gaussian kernel for vectors u, v is defined as follows:
         K(u, v) = exp(-||u-v||^2 / (2* stddev^2))
    where the norm is the l2-norm. x, y can be either vectors or matrices. If
    they are vectors, they must have the same dimension. If they are matrices,
    they must have the same number of columns. In the latter case, the method
    returns (as a matrix) K(u, v) values for all pairs (u, v) where u is a row
    from x and v is a row from y.

    Args:
      x: a tensor of rank 1 or 2. It's shape should be either [dim] or [m, dim].
      y: a tensor of rank 1 or 2. It's shape should be either [dim] or [n, dim].
      stddev: The width of the Gaussian kernel.

    Returns:
      A single value (scalar) with shape (1, 1) (if x, y are vectors) or a
      matrix of shape (m, n) with entries K(u, v) (where K is the Gaussian
      kernel) for all (u,v) pairs where u, v are rows from x and y respectively.

    Raises:
      ValueError: if the shapes of x, y are not compatible.
