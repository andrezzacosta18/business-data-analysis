class gaussian_kde:
    '''Representation of a kernel-density estimate using Gaussian kernels.

    Kernel density estimation is a way to estimate the probability density
    function (PDF) of a random variable in a non-parametric way.
    `gaussian_kde` works for both uni-variate and multi-variate data.   It
    includes automatic bandwidth determination.  The estimation works best for
    a unimodal distribution; bimodal or multi-modal distributions tend to be
    oversmoothed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : array_like
        Datapoints to estimate from. In case of univariate data this is a 1-D
        array, otherwise a 2-D array with shape (# of dims, # of data).
    bw_method : str, scalar or callable, optional
        The method used to calculate the estimator bandwidth.  This can be
        \'scott\', \'silverman\', a scalar constant or a callable.  If a scalar,
        this will be used directly as `kde.factor`.  If a callable, it should
        take a `gaussian_kde` instance as only parameter and return a scalar.
        If None (default), \'scott\' is used.  See Notes for more details.
    weights : array_like, optional
        weights of datapoints. This must be the same shape as dataset.
        If None (default), the samples are assumed to be equally weighted

    Attributes
    ----------
    dataset : ndarray
        The dataset with which `gaussian_kde` was initialized.
    d : int
        Number of dimensions.
    n : int
        Number of datapoints.
    neff : int
        Effective number of datapoints.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2.0
    factor : float
        The bandwidth factor, obtained from `kde.covariance_factor`, with which
        the covariance matrix is multiplied.
    covariance : ndarray
        The covariance matrix of `dataset`, scaled by the calculated bandwidth
        (`kde.factor`).
    inv_cov : ndarray
        The inverse of `covariance`.

    set_bandwidth
    covariance_factor

    Notes
    -----
    Bandwidth selection strongly influences the estimate obtained from the KDE
    (much more so than the actual shape of the kernel).  Bandwidth selection
    can be done by a "rule of thumb", by cross-validation, by "plug-in
    methods" or by other means; see [3]_, [4]_ for reviews.  `gaussian_kde`
    uses a rule of thumb, the default is Scott\'s Rule.

    Scott\'s Rule [1]_, implemented as `scotts_factor`, is::

        n**(-1./(d+4)),

    with ``n`` the number of data points and ``d`` the number of dimensions.
    In the case of unequally weighted points, `scotts_factor` becomes::

        neff**(-1./(d+4)),

    with ``neff`` the effective number of datapoints.
    Silverman\'s Rule [2]_, implemented as `silverman_factor`, is::

        (n * (d + 2) / 4.)**(-1. / (d + 4)).

    or in the case of unequally weighted points::

        (neff * (d + 2) / 4.)**(-1. / (d + 4)).

    Good general descriptions of kernel density estimation can be found in [1]_
    and [2]_, the mathematics for this multi-dimensional implementation can be
    found in [1]_.

    With a set of weighted samples, the effective number of datapoints ``neff``
    is defined by::

        neff = sum(weights)^2 / sum(weights^2)

    as detailed in [5]_.
