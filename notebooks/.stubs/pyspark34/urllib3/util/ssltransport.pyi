    The SSLTransport wraps an existing socket and establishes an SSL connection.

    Contrary to Python's implementation of SSLSocket, it allows you to chain
    multiple TLS connections together. It's particularly useful if you need to
    implement TLS within TLS.

    The class supports most of the socket API operations.
