        5.3.1.  UserInfo Request
        The Client sends the UserInfo Request using either HTTP GET or HTTP
        POST. The Access Token obtained from an OpenID Connect Authentication
        Request MUST be sent as a Bearer Token, per `Section 2`_ of OAuth 2.0
        Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750].

        It is RECOMMENDED that the request use the HTTP GET method and the
        Access Token be sent using the Authorization header field.

        The following is a non-normative example of a UserInfo Request:

        .. code-block:: http

            GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1
            Host: server.example.com
            Authorization: Bearer SlAV32hkKG

        5.3.3. UserInfo Error Response
        When an error condition occurs, the UserInfo Endpoint returns an Error
        Response as defined in `Section 3`_ of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage
        [RFC6750]. (HTTP errors unrelated to RFC 6750 are returned to the User
        Agent using the appropriate HTTP status code.)

        The following is a non-normative example of a UserInfo Error Response:

        .. code-block:: http

            HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
            WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token",
                error_description="The Access Token expired"

        .. _`Section 2`: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-2
        .. _`Section 3`: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3
