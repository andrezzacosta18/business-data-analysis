                         authorization as described in `Section 3.1.2`_.
    :param scope: The scope of the access request as described by

                  state between the request and callback.  The authorization
                  server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent
                  back to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for

                  `Section 10.12`_.
    :param code_challenge: PKCE parameter. A challenge derived from the 
                           code_verifier that is sent in the authorization 
                           request, to be verified against later.
    :param code_challenge_method: PKCE parameter. A method that was used to derive the 
                                  code_challenge. Defaults to "plain" if not present in the request.

    If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
    server issues an authorization code and delivers it to the client by
    adding the following parameters to the query component of the
    redirection URI using the ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format:

    **code**
            REQUIRED.  The authorization code generated by the
            authorization server.  The authorization code MUST expire
            shortly after it is issued to mitigate the risk of leaks.  A
            maximum authorization code lifetime of 10 minutes is
            RECOMMENDED.  The client MUST NOT use the authorization code
            more than once.  If an authorization code is used more than
            once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and SHOULD
            revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on
            that authorization code.  The authorization code is bound to
            the client identifier and redirection URI.

    **state**
            REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
            authorization request.  The exact value received from the
            client.

    :param uri: The full redirect URL back to the client.
    :param state: The state parameter from the authorization request.

    For example, the authorization server redirects the user-agent by
    sending the following HTTP response:

    .. code-block:: http

        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA

def parse_implicit_response(uri, state: Incomplete | None = None, scope: Incomplete | None = None):
    '''Parse the implicit token response URI into a dict.

    If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
    server issues an access token and delivers it to the client by adding
    the following parameters to the fragment component of the redirection
    URI using the ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` format:

    **access_token**
            REQUIRED.  The access token issued by the authorization server.

    **token_type**
            REQUIRED.  The type of the token issued as described in
            Section 7.1.  Value is case insensitive.

    **expires_in**
            RECOMMENDED.  The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For
            example, the value "3600" denotes that the access token will
            expire in one hour from the time the response was generated.
            If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the
            expiration time via other means or document the default value.

    **scope**
            OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested by the client,
            otherwise REQUIRED.  The scope of the access token as described
            by Section 3.3.

    **state**
            REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
            authorization request.  The exact value received from the
            client.

    :param uri:
    :param state:
    :param scope:

    Similar to the authorization code response, but with a full token provided
    in the URL fragment:

def parse_token_response(body, scope: Incomplete | None = None):

    The authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
    token, and constructs the response by adding the following parameters
    to the entity body of the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code:

    access_token
            REQUIRED.  The access token issued by the authorization server.
    token_type
            REQUIRED.  The type of the token issued as described in
            `Section 7.1`_.  Value is case insensitive.

            RECOMMENDED.  The lifetime in seconds of the access token.  For

            If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the
            expiration time via other means or document the default value.
    refresh_token
            OPTIONAL.  The refresh token which can be used to obtain new
            access tokens using the same authorization grant as described
            in `Section 6`_.
    scope
            OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested by the client,
            otherwise REQUIRED.  The scope of the access token as described
            by `Section 3.3`_.

    The parameters are included in the entity body of the HTTP response
    using the "application/json" media type as defined by [`RFC4627`_].  The
    parameters are serialized into a JSON structure by adding each
    parameter at the highest structure level.  Parameter names and string
    values are included as JSON strings.  Numerical values are included
    as JSON numbers.  The order of parameters does not matter and can
    vary.

    :param body: The full json encoded response body.
    :param scope: The scope requested during authorization.
