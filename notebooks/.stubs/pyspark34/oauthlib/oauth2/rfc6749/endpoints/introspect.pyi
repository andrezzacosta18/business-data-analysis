   This endpoint defines a method to query an OAuth 2.0 authorization
   server to determine the active state of an OAuth 2.0 token and to
   determine meta-information about this token. OAuth 2.0 deployments
   can use this method to convey information about the authorization
   context of the token from the authorization server to the protected
   resource.

   To prevent the values of access tokens from leaking into
   server-side logs via query parameters, an authorization server
   offering token introspection MAY disallow the use of HTTP GET on
   the introspection endpoint and instead require the HTTP POST method
   to be used at the introspection endpoint.

        A hint about the type of the token submitted for
        introspection.  The protected resource MAY pass this parameter to
        help the authorization server optimize the token lookup.  If the
        server is unable to locate the token using the given hint, it MUST
        extend its search across all of its supported token types.  An
        authorization server MAY ignore this parameter, particularly if it
        is able to detect the token type automatically.

        The introspection endpoint MAY accept other OPTIONAL
        parameters to provide further context to the query.  For
        instance, an authorization server may desire to know the IP
        address of the client accessing the protected resource to
        determine if the correct client is likely to be presenting the
        token.  The definition of this or any other parameters are
        outside the scope of this specification, to be defined by
        service documentation or extensions to this specification.
