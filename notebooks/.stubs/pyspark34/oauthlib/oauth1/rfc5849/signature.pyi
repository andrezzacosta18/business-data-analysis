    ends or the signature won't verify.

    Calculates the _base string URI_.

    The *base string URI* is one of the components that make up the
     *signature base string*.

    The ``host`` is optional. If provided, it is used to override any host and
    port values in the ``uri``. The value for ``host`` is usually extracted from
    the "Host" request header from the HTTP request. Its value may be just the
    hostname, or the hostname followed by a colon and a TCP/IP port number
    (hostname:port). If a value for the``host`` is provided but it does not
    contain a port number, the default port number is used (i.e. if the ``uri``
    contained a port number, it will be discarded).
