    """
    A helper function to set a given tensor (parameter of buffer) of a module on a specific device (note that doing
    `param.to(device)` creates a new tensor not linked to the parameter, which is why we need this function). The
    function is adapted from `set_module_tensor_to_device` function from accelerate that is adapted to support the
    class `Int8Params` from `bitsandbytes`.

    Args:
        module (`torch.nn.Module`):
            The module in which the tensor we want to move lives.
        tensor_name (`str`):
            The full name of the parameter/buffer.
        device (`int`, `str` or `torch.device`):
            The device on which to set the tensor.
        value (`torch.Tensor`, *optional*):
            The value of the tensor (useful when going from the meta device to any other device).

def replace_8bit_linear(model, threshold: float = 6.0, modules_to_not_convert: str = 'lm_head'):
    """
    A helper function to replace all `torch.nn.Linear` modules by `bnb.nn.Linear8bit` modules from the `bitsandbytes`
    library. This will enable running your models using mixed int8 precision as described by the paper `GPT3.int8():
    8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale`. Make sure `bitsandbytes` compiled with the correct CUDA
    version of your hardware is installed before running this function. `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/
    bitsandbytes`

    The function will be run recursively and replace all `torch.nn.Linear` modules except for the `lm_head` that should
    be kept as a `torch.nn.Linear` module. The replacement is done under `init_empty_weights` context manager so no
    CPU/GPU memory is required to run this function. Int8 mixed-precision matrix decomposition works by separating a
    matrix multiplication into two streams: (1) and systematic feature outlier stream matrix multiplied in fp16
    (0.01%), (2) a regular stream of int8 matrix multiplication (99.9%). With this method, int8 inference with no
    predictive degradation is possible for very large models (>=176B parameters).

    Parameters:
        model (`torch.nn.Module`):
            Input model or `torch.nn.Module` as the function is run recursively.
        threshold (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 6.0):
            `int8_threshold` for outlier detection as described in the formentioned paper. This parameters is set to
            `6.0` as described by the paper.
        modules_to_not_convert (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `lm_head`):
            Name of the module to not convert in `Linear8bitLt`. In practice we keep the `lm_head` in full precision
            for numerical stability reasons.
    """
def get_keys_to_not_convert(model):
    """
    An utility function to get the key of the module to keep in full precision if any For example for CausalLM modules
    we may want to keep the lm_head in full precision for numerical stability reasons. For other architectures, we want
    to keep the tied weights of the model. The function will return a list of the keys of the modules to not convert in
    int8.

    Parameters:
    model (`torch.nn.Module`):
        Input model
