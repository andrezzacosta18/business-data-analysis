    Constructs a Wav2Vec2 processor which wraps a Wav2Vec2 feature extractor and a Wav2Vec2 CTC tokenizer into a single
    processor.

    [`Wav2Vec2Processor`] offers all the functionalities of [`Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor`] and [`PreTrainedTokenizer`].
    See the docstring of [`~Wav2Vec2Processor.__call__`] and [`~Wav2Vec2Processor.decode`] for more information.

        tokenizer ([`PreTrainedTokenizer`]):
            An instance of [`PreTrainedTokenizer`]. The tokenizer is a required input.
