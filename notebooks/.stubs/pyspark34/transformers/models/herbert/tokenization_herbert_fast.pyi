class HerbertTokenizerFast(PreTrainedTokenizerFast):
    '''
    Construct a "Fast" BPE tokenizer for HerBERT (backed by HuggingFace\'s *tokenizers* library).

    Peculiarities:

    - uses BERT\'s pre-tokenizer: BertPreTokenizer splits tokens on spaces, and also on punctuation. Each occurrence of
      a punctuation character will be treated separately.

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the methods. Users should refer to the
    superclass for more information regarding methods.

            Path to the vocabulary file.
        merges_file (`str`):
            Path to the merges file.
