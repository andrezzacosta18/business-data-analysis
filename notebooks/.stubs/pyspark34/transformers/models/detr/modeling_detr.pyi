            targets (`List[dict]`):
                A list of targets (len(targets) = batch_size), where each target is a dict containing:
                * "class_labels": Tensor of dim [num_target_boxes] (where num_target_boxes is the number of
                  ground-truth
                 objects in the target) containing the class labels
                * "boxes": Tensor of dim [num_target_boxes, 4] containing the target box coordinates.

        Returns:
            `List[Tuple]`: A list of size `batch_size`, containing tuples of (index_i, index_j) where:
            - index_i is the indices of the selected predictions (in order)
            - index_j is the indices of the corresponding selected targets (in order)
            For each batch element, it holds: len(index_i) = len(index_j) = min(num_queries, num_target_boxes)
