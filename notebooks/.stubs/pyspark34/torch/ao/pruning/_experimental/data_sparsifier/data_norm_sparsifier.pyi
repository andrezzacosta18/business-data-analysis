    '''L1-Norm Sparsifier
    This sparsifier computes the *L1-norm* of every sparse block and "zeroes-out" the
    ones with the lowest norm. The level of sparsity defines how many of the
    blocks is removed.
    This sparsifier is controlled by three variables:
    1. `sparsity_level` defines the number of *sparse blocks* that are zeroed-out
    2. `sparse_block_shape` defines the shape of the sparse blocks. Note that
        the sparse blocks originate at the zero-index of the tensor.
    3. `zeros_per_block` is the number of zeros that we are expecting in each
        sparse block. By default we assume that all elements within a block are
        zeroed-out. However, setting this variable sets the target number of
        zeros per block. The zeros within each block are chosen as the *smallest
        absolute values*.
    Args:
        sparsity_level: The target level of sparsity
        sparse_block_shape: The shape of a sparse block
        zeros_per_block: Number of zeros in a sparse block
    Note::
        All arguments to the DataNormSparsifier constructor are "default"
        arguments and could be overriden by the configuration provided in the
        `add_data` step.
