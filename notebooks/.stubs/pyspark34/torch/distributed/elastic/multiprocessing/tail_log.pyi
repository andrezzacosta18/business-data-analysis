class TailLog:
    '''
    Tails the given log files. The log files do not have to exist when the
    ``start()`` method is called. The tail-er will gracefully wait until the
    log files are created by the producer and will tail the contents of the
    log files until the ``stop()`` method is called.

    .. warning:: ``TailLog`` will wait indefinitely for the log file to be created!

    Each log file\'s line will be suffixed with a header of the form: ``[{name}{idx}]:``,
    where the ``name`` is user-provided and ``idx`` is the index of the log file
    in the ``log_files`` mapping.

    Usage:

    ::

     log_files = {0: "/tmp/0_stdout.log", 1: "/tmp/1_stdout.log"}
     tailer = TailLog("trainer", log_files, sys.stdout).start()
     # actually run the trainers to produce 0_stdout.log and 1_stdout.log
     run_trainers()
     tailer.stop()

     # once run_trainers() start writing the ##_stdout.log files
     # the tailer will print to sys.stdout:
     # >>> [trainer0]:log_line1
     # >>> [trainer1]:log_line1
     # >>> [trainer0]:log_line2
     # >>> [trainer0]:log_line3
     # >>> [trainer1]:log_line2

    .. note:: Due to buffering log lines between files may not necessarily
              be printed out in order. You should configure your application\'s
              logger to suffix each log line with a proper timestamp.
