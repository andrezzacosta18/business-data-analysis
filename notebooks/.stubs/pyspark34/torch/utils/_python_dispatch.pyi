class TorchDispatchMode:
    """
    A ``TorchDispatchMode`` allows you to override the meaning of all
    ``__torch_dispatch__`` overrideable functions within a dynamic scope,
    without having to actually create a tensor subclass or manually
    monkey-patch functions in the PyTorch API.  Some common situations
    where you should use a mode:

        * You want to override the meaning of factory functions, or other
          functions that do not otherwise take a tensor as an argument
          (these cannot be overridden with tensor subclasses).

        * You want to override the behavior of all functions without needing
          to wrap your inputs in tensor subclasses; e.g., if you are just
          interested in logging intermediate computations.

        * You want to control the order of execution of various tensor
          subclasses explicitly, rather than implicitly via the return of
          ``NotImplemented``.

    Independent subclasses of :class:`TorchDispatchMode` are compositional:
    modes can be pushed onto a stack using ``with MyMode():``.
    When you call functions in the PyTorch API inside your
    ``__torch_dispatch__`` implementation, by default, they will forward on to
    the next mode on the mode stack.  If you want recursively call back into
    your current ``__torch_dispatch__`` implementation, either explicitly
    invoke ``self.__torch_dispatch__(...)``, or use the context manager
    ``__torch_dispatch__(self)`` to make PyTorch
    API self-referential (beware of infinite loops, in this case!)
