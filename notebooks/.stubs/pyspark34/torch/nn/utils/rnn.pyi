    """Holds the data and list of :attr:`batch_sizes` of a packed sequence.

    All RNN modules accept packed sequences as inputs.

    Note:
        Instances of this class should never be created manually. They are meant
        to be instantiated by functions like :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.

        Batch sizes represent the number elements at each sequence step in
        the batch, not the varying sequence lengths passed to
        :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.  For instance, given data ``abc`` and ``x``
        the :class:`PackedSequence` would contain data ``axbc`` with
        ``batch_sizes=[2,1,1]``.

    Attributes:
        data (Tensor): Tensor containing packed sequence
        batch_sizes (Tensor): Tensor of integers holding
            information about the batch size at each sequence step
        sorted_indices (Tensor, optional): Tensor of integers holding how this
            :class:`PackedSequence` is constructed from sequences.
        unsorted_indices (Tensor, optional): Tensor of integers holding how this
            to recover the original sequences with correct order.

    .. note::
        :attr:`data` can be on arbitrary device and of arbitrary dtype.
        :attr:`sorted_indices` and :attr:`unsorted_indices` must be ``torch.int64``
        tensors on the same device as :attr:`data`.

        However, :attr:`batch_sizes` should always be a CPU ``torch.int64`` tensor.

        This invariant is maintained throughout :class:`PackedSequence` class,
        and all functions that construct a `:class:PackedSequence` in PyTorch
        (i.e., they only pass in tensors conforming to this constraint).
