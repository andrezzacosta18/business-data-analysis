def power(G, k):
    '''Returns the specified power of a graph.

    The $k$th power of a simple graph $G$, denoted $G^k$, is a
    graph on the same set of nodes in which two distinct nodes $u$ and
    $v$ are adjacent in $G^k$ if and only if the shortest path
    distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$ is at most $k$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX simple graph object.

    k : positive integer
        The power to which to raise the graph `G`.

    Returns
    -------
    NetworkX simple graph
        `G` to the power `k`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the exponent `k` is not positive.

    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is not a simple graph.

    Examples
    --------
    The number of edges will never decrease when taking successive
    powers:

    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> list(nx.power(G, 2).edges)
    [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
    >>> list(nx.power(G, 3).edges)
    [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]

    The `k`\\ th power of a cycle graph on *n* nodes is the complete graph
    on *n* nodes, if `k` is at least ``n // 2``:

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(5)
    >>> H = nx.complete_graph(5)
    >>> nx.is_isomorphic(nx.power(G, 2), H)
    True
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(8)
    >>> H = nx.complete_graph(8)
    >>> nx.is_isomorphic(nx.power(G, 4), H)
    True

    A new graph is constructed representing the rooted product of
