class ISMAGS:
    '''
    Implements the ISMAGS subgraph matching algorithm. [1]_ ISMAGS stands for
    "Index-based Subgraph Matching Algorithm with General Symmetries". As the
    name implies, it is symmetry aware and will only generate non-symmetric
    isomorphisms.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation imposes additional conditions compared to the VF2
    algorithm on the graphs provided and the comparison functions
    (:attr:`node_equality` and :attr:`edge_equality`):

     - Node keys in both graphs must be orderable as well as hashable.
     - Equality must be transitive: if A is equal to B, and B is equal to C,
       then A must be equal to C.

    Attributes
    ----------
    graph: networkx.Graph
    subgraph: networkx.Graph
    node_equality: collections.abc.Callable
        The function called to see if two nodes should be considered equal.
        It\'s signature looks like this:
        ``f(graph1: networkx.Graph, node1, graph2: networkx.Graph, node2) -> bool``.
        `node1` is a node in `graph1`, and `node2` a node in `graph2`.
        Constructed from the argument `node_match`.
    edge_equality: collections.abc.Callable
        The function called to see if two edges should be considered equal.
        It\'s signature looks like this:
        ``f(graph1: networkx.Graph, edge1, graph2: networkx.Graph, edge2) -> bool``.
        `edge1` is an edge in `graph1`, and `edge2` an edge in `graph2`.
        Constructed from the argument `edge_match`.

            If `None`, all nodes are considered equal.

    def analyze_symmetry(self, graph, node_partitions, edge_colors):

        Find a minimal set of permutations and corresponding co-sets that
        describe the symmetry of `graph`, given the node and edge equalities
        given by `node_partitions` and `edge_colors`, respectively.

        Parameters
        ----------
        graph : networkx.Graph
            The graph whose symmetry should be analyzed.
        node_partitions : list of sets
            A list of sets containing node keys. Node keys in the same set
            are considered equivalent. Every node key in `graph` should be in
            exactly one of the sets. If all nodes are equivalent, this should
            be ``[set(graph.nodes)]``.
        edge_colors : dict mapping edges to their colors
            A dict mapping every edge in `graph` to its corresponding color.
            Edges with the same color are considered equivalent. If all edges
            are equivalent, this should be ``{e: 0 for e in graph.edges}``.

        dict[collections.abc.Hashable, set[collections.abc.Hashable]]
            The found co-sets. The co-sets is a dictionary of
            ``{node key: set of node keys}``.
            Every key-value pair describes which ``values`` can be interchanged
            without changing nodes less than ``key``.
