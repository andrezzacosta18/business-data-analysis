    '''Generate edges in a minimum spanning forest of an undirected
    weighted graph.

    A minimum spanning tree is a subgraph of the graph (a tree)
    with the minimum sum of edge weights.  A spanning forest is a
    union of the spanning trees for each connected component of the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected Graph
       An undirected graph. If `G` is connected, then the algorithm finds a
       spanning tree. Otherwise, a spanning forest is found.

    algorithm : string
       The algorithm to use when finding a minimum spanning tree. Valid
       choices are \'kruskal\', \'prim\', or \'boruvka\'. The default is \'kruskal\'.

    weight : string
       Edge data key to use for weight (default \'weight\').

    keys : bool
       Whether to yield edge key in multigraphs in addition to the edge.
       If `G` is not a multigraph, this is ignored.

    data : bool, optional
       If True yield the edge data along with the edge.

    ignore_nan : bool (default: False)
        If a NaN is found as an edge weight normally an exception is raised.
        If `ignore_nan is True` then that edge is ignored instead.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : iterator
       An iterator over edges in a maximum spanning tree of `G`.
       Edges connecting nodes `u` and `v` are represented as tuples:
       `(u, v, k, d)` or `(u, v, k)` or `(u, v, d)` or `(u, v)`

       If `G` is a multigraph, `keys` indicates whether the edge key `k` will
       be reported in the third position in the edge tuple. `data` indicates
       whether the edge datadict `d` will appear at the end of the edge tuple.

       If `G` is not a multigraph, the tuples are `(u, v, d)` if `data` is True
       or `(u, v)` if `data` is False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import tree

    Find minimum spanning edges by Kruskal\'s algorithm

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3, weight=2)
    >>> mst = tree.minimum_spanning_edges(G, algorithm="kruskal", data=False)
    >>> edgelist = list(mst)
    >>> sorted(sorted(e) for e in edgelist)
    [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]

    Find minimum spanning edges by Prim\'s algorithm

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3, weight=2)
    >>> mst = tree.minimum_spanning_edges(G, algorithm="prim", data=False)
    >>> edgelist = list(mst)
    >>> sorted(sorted(e) for e in edgelist)
    [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]

    Notes
    -----
    For Borůvka\'s algorithm, each edge must have a weight attribute, and
    each edge weight must be distinct.

    For the other algorithms, if the graph edges do not have a weight
    attribute a default weight of 1 will be used.

    Sample a random spanning tree using the edges weights of `G`.

    This function supports two different methods for determining the
    probability of the graph. If ``multiplicative=True``, the probability
    is based on the product of edge weights, and if ``multiplicative=False``
    it is based on the sum of the edge weight. However, since it is
    easier to determine the total weight of all spanning trees for the
    multiplicative version, that is significantly faster and should be used if
    possible. Additionally, setting `weight` to `None` will cause a spanning tree
    to be selected with uniform probability.

    The function uses algorithm A8 in [1]_ .

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.Graph
        An undirected version of the original graph.

    weight : string
        The edge key for the edge attribute holding edge weight.

    multiplicative : bool, default=True
        If `True`, the probability of each tree is the product of its edge weight
        over the sum of the product of all the spanning trees in the graph. If
        `False`, the probability is the sum of its edge weight over the sum of
