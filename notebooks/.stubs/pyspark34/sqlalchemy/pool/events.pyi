    '''Available events for :class:`_pool.Pool`.

    The methods here define the name of an event as well
    as the names of members that are passed to listener
    functions.

    e.g.::

        from sqlalchemy import event

        def my_on_checkout(dbapi_conn, connection_rec, connection_proxy):
            "handle an on checkout event"

        event.listen(Pool, \'checkout\', my_on_checkout)

    In addition to accepting the :class:`_pool.Pool` class and
    :class:`_pool.Pool` instances, :class:`_events.PoolEvents` also accepts
    :class:`_engine.Engine` objects and the :class:`_engine.Engine` class as
    targets, which will be resolved to the ``.pool`` attribute of the
    given engine or the :class:`_pool.Pool` class::

        engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost/test")

        # will associate with engine.pool
        event.listen(engine, \'checkout\', my_on_checkout)

        The rationale for :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.first_connect`
        is to determine
        information about a particular series of database connections based
        on the settings used for all connections.  Since a particular
        :class:`_pool.Pool`
        refers to a single "creator" function (which in terms
        of a :class:`_engine.Engine`
        refers to the URL and connection options used),
        it is typically valid to make observations about a single connection
        that can be safely assumed to be valid about all subsequent
        connections, such as the database version, the server and client
        encoding settings, collation settings, and many others.

    def reset(self, dbapi_connection: DBAPIConnection, connection_record: ConnectionPoolEntry, reset_state: PoolResetState) -> None:
        '''Called before the "reset" action occurs for a pooled connection.

        This event represents
        when the ``rollback()`` method is called on the DBAPI connection
        before it is returned to the pool or discarded.
        A custom "reset" strategy may be implemented using this event hook,
        which may also be combined with disabling the default "reset"
        behavior using the :paramref:`_pool.Pool.reset_on_return` parameter.

        The primary difference between the :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.reset` and
        :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.checkin` events are that
        :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.reset` is called not just for pooled
        connections that are being returned to the pool, but also for
        connections that were detached using the
        :meth:`_engine.Connection.detach` method as well as asyncio connections
        that are being discarded due to garbage collection taking place on
        connections before the connection was checked in.

        Note that the event **is not** invoked for connections that were
        invalidated using :meth:`_engine.Connection.invalidate`.    These
        events may be intercepted using the :meth:`.PoolEvents.soft_invalidate`
        and :meth:`.PoolEvents.invalidate` event hooks, and all "connection
        close" events may be intercepted using :meth:`.PoolEvents.close`.

        The :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.reset` event is usually followed by the
        :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.checkin` event, except in those
        cases where the connection is discarded immediately after reset.
