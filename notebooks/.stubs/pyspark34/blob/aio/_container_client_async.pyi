class ContainerClient(AsyncStorageAccountHostsMixin, ContainerClientBase, StorageEncryptionMixin):
    '''A client to interact with a specific container, although that container
    may not yet exist.

    For operations relating to a specific blob within this container, a blob client can be
    retrieved using the :func:`~get_blob_client` function.

    :param str account_url:
        The URI to the storage account. In order to create a client given the full URI to the container,
        use the :func:`from_container_url` classmethod.
    :param container_name:
        The name of the container for the blob.
    :type container_name: str
    :param credential:
        The credentials with which to authenticate. This is optional if the
        account URL already has a SAS token. The value can be a SAS token string,
        an instance of a AzureSasCredential or AzureNamedKeyCredential from azure.core.credentials,
        an account shared access key, or an instance of a TokenCredentials class from azure.identity.
        If the resource URI already contains a SAS token, this will be ignored in favor of an explicit credential
        - except in the case of AzureSasCredential, where the conflicting SAS tokens will raise a ValueError.
        If using an instance of AzureNamedKeyCredential, "name" should be the storage account name, and "key"
        should be the storage account key.
    :keyword str api_version:
        The Storage API version to use for requests. Default value is the most recent service version that is
        compatible with the current SDK. Setting to an older version may result in reduced feature compatibility.

        .. versionadded:: 12.2.0

    :keyword str secondary_hostname:
        The hostname of the secondary endpoint.
    :keyword int max_block_size: The maximum chunk size for uploading a block blob in chunks.
        Defaults to 4*1024*1024, or 4MB.
    :keyword int max_single_put_size: If the blob size is less than or equal max_single_put_size, then the blob will be
        uploaded with only one http PUT request. If the blob size is larger than max_single_put_size,
        the blob will be uploaded in chunks. Defaults to 64*1024*1024, or 64MB.
    :keyword int min_large_block_upload_threshold: The minimum chunk size required to use the memory efficient
        algorithm when uploading a block blob. Defaults to 4*1024*1024+1.
    :keyword bool use_byte_buffer: Use a byte buffer for block blob uploads. Defaults to False.
    :keyword int max_page_size: The maximum chunk size for uploading a page blob. Defaults to 4*1024*1024, or 4MB.
    :keyword int max_single_get_size: The maximum size for a blob to be downloaded in a single call,
        the exceeded part will be downloaded in chunks (could be parallel). Defaults to 32*1024*1024, or 32MB.
    :keyword int max_chunk_get_size: The maximum chunk size used for downloading a blob. Defaults to 4*1024*1024,
        or 4MB.
