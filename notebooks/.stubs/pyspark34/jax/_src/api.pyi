    '''Sets up ``fun`` for just-in-time compilation with XLA.

  Args:
    fun: Function to be jitted. ``fun`` should be a pure function, as
      side-effects may only be executed once.

      The arguments and return value of ``fun`` should be arrays,
      scalars, or (nested) standard Python containers (tuple/list/dict) thereof.
      Positional arguments indicated by ``static_argnums`` can be anything at
      all, provided they are hashable and have an equality operation defined.
      Static arguments are included as part of a compilation cache key, which is
      why hash and equality operators must be defined.

      JAX keeps a weak reference to ``fun`` for use as a compilation cache key,
      so the object ``fun`` must be weakly-referenceable. Most :class:`Callable`
      objects will already satisfy this requirement.
    in_shardings: Pytree of structure matching that of arguments to ``fun``,
      with all actual arguments replaced by resource assignment specifications.
      It is also valid to specify a pytree prefix (e.g. one value in place of a
      whole subtree), in which case the leaves get broadcast to all values in
      that subtree.

      The ``in_shardings`` argument is optional. JAX will infer the shardings
      from the input :py:class:`jax.Array`\'s and defaults to replicating the input
      if the sharding cannot be inferred.

      The valid resource assignment specifications are:
        - :py:class:`XLACompatibleSharding`, which will decide how the value
            will be partitioned. With this, using a mesh context manager is not
            required.
        - :py:obj:`None`, will give JAX the freedom to choose whatever sharding
          it wants.
          For in_shardings, JAX will mark is as replicated but this behavior
          can change in the future.
          For out_shardings, we will rely on the XLA GSPMD partitioner to
          determine the output shardings.

      The size of every dimension has to be a multiple of the total number of
      resources assigned to it. This is similar to pjit\'s in_shardings.
    out_shardings: Like ``in_shardings``, but specifies resource
      assignment for function outputs. This is similar to pjit\'s
      out_shardings.

      The ``out_shardings`` argument is optional. If not specified, :py:func:`jax.jit`
      will use GSPMD\'s sharding propagation to figure out what the sharding of the
      output(s) should be.
    static_argnums: An optional int or collection of ints that specify which
      positional arguments to treat as static (compile-time constant).
      Operations that only depend on static arguments will be constant-folded in
      Python (during tracing), and so the corresponding argument values can be
      any Python object.

      Static arguments should be hashable, meaning both ``__hash__`` and
      ``__eq__`` are implemented, and immutable. Calling the jitted function
      with different values for these constants will trigger recompilation.
      Arguments that are not arrays or containers thereof must be marked as
      static.

      If neither ``static_argnums`` nor ``static_argnames`` is provided, no
      arguments are treated as static. If ``static_argnums`` is not provided but
      ``static_argnames`` is, or vice versa, JAX uses
      :code:`inspect.signature(fun)` to find any positional arguments that
      correspond to ``static_argnames``
      (or vice versa). If both ``static_argnums`` and ``static_argnames`` are
      provided, ``inspect.signature`` is not used, and only actual
      parameters listed in either ``static_argnums`` or ``static_argnames`` will
      be treated as static.
    static_argnames: An optional string or collection of strings specifying
      which named arguments to treat as static (compile-time constant). See the
      comment on ``static_argnums`` for details. If not
      provided but ``static_argnums`` is set, the default is based on calling
      ``inspect.signature(fun)`` to find corresponding named arguments.
    donate_argnums: Specify which positional argument buffers are "donated" to
      the computation. It is safe to donate argument buffers if you no longer
      need them once the computation has finished. In some cases XLA can make
      use of donated buffers to reduce the amount of memory needed to perform a
      computation, for example recycling one of your input buffers to store a
      result. You should not reuse buffers that you donate to a computation, JAX
      will raise an error if you try to. By default, no argument buffers are
      donated.

      If neither ``donate_argnums`` nor ``donate_argnames`` is provided, no
      arguments are donated. If ``donate_argnums`` is not provided but
      ``donate_argnames`` is, or vice versa, JAX uses
      :code:`inspect.signature(fun)` to find any positional arguments that
      correspond to ``donate_argnames``
      (or vice versa). If both ``donate_argnums`` and ``donate_argnames`` are
      provided, ``inspect.signature`` is not used, and only actual
      parameters listed in either ``donate_argnums`` or ``donate_argnames`` will
      be donated.

      For more details on buffer donation see the
      `FAQ <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#buffer-donation>`_.
    donate_argnames: An optional string or collection of strings specifying
      which named arguments are donated to the computation. See the
      comment on ``donate_argnums`` for details. If not
      provided but ``donate_argnums`` is set, the default is based on calling
      ``inspect.signature(fun)`` to find corresponding named arguments.
    keep_unused: If `False` (the default), arguments that JAX determines to be
      unused by `fun` *may* be dropped from resulting compiled XLA executables.
      Such arguments will not be transferred to the device nor provided to the
      underlying executable. If `True`, unused arguments will not be pruned.
    device: This is an experimental feature and the API is likely to change.
      Optional, the Device the jitted function will run on. (Available devices
      can be retrieved via :py:func:`jax.devices`.) The default is inherited
      from XLA\'s DeviceAssignment logic and is usually to use
      ``jax.devices()[0]``.
    backend: This is an experimental feature and the API is likely to change.
      Optional, a string representing the XLA backend: ``\'cpu\'``, ``\'gpu\'``, or
      ``\'tpu\'``.
    inline: Specify whether this function should be inlined into enclosing
      jaxprs (rather than being represented as an application of the xla_call
      primitive with its own subjaxpr). Default False.

  Returns:
    A wrapped version of ``fun``, set up for just-in-time compilation.

  Examples:
    In the following example, ``selu`` can be compiled into a single fused kernel
    by XLA:

    >>> import jax
    >>>
    >>> @jax.jit
    ... def selu(x, alpha=1.67, lmbda=1.05):
    ...   return lmbda * jax.numpy.where(x > 0, x, alpha * jax.numpy.exp(x) - alpha)
    >>>
    >>> key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
    >>> x = jax.random.normal(key, (10,))
    >>> print(selu(x))  # doctest: +SKIP
    [-0.54485  0.27744 -0.29255 -0.91421 -0.62452 -0.24748
    -0.85743 -0.78232  0.76827  0.59566 ]

    To pass arguments such as ``static_argnames`` when decorating a function, a common
    pattern is to use :func:`functools.partial`:

    >>> from functools import partial
    >>>
    >>> @partial(jax.jit, static_argnames=[\'n\'])
    ... def g(x, n):
    ...   for i in range(n):
    ...     x = x ** 2
    ...   return x
    >>>
    >>> g(jnp.arange(4), 3)
    Array([   0,    1,  256, 6561], dtype=int32)
  '''
def disable_jit(disable: bool = True):
    '''Context manager that disables :py:func:`jit` behavior under its dynamic context.

  For debugging it is useful to have a mechanism that disables :py:func:`jit`
  everywhere in a dynamic context. Note that this not only disables explicit
  uses of :func:`jit` by the user, but will also remove any implicit JIT compilation
  used by the JAX library: this includes implicit JIT computation of `body` and
  `cond` functions passed to higher-level primitives like :func:`~jax.lax.scan` and
  :func:`~jax.lax.while_loop`, JIT used in implementations of :mod:`jax.numpy` functions,
  and any other case where :func:`jit` is used within an API\'s implementation.

  Values that have a data dependence on the arguments to a jitted function are
  traced and abstracted. For example, an abstract value may be a
  :py:class:`ShapedArray` instance, representing the set of all possible arrays
  with a given shape and dtype, but not representing one concrete array with
  specific values. You might notice those if you use a benign side-effecting
  operation in a jitted function, like a print:

  >>> import jax
  >>>
  >>> @jax.jit
  ... def f(x):
  ...   y = x * 2
  ...   print("Value of y is", y)
  ...   return y + 3
  ...
  >>> print(f(jax.numpy.array([1, 2, 3])))  # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
  Value of y is Traced<ShapedArray(int32[3])>with<DynamicJaxprTrace...>
  [5 7 9]

  Here ``y`` has been abstracted by :py:func:`jit` to a :py:class:`ShapedArray`,
  which represents an array with a fixed shape and type but an arbitrary value.
  The value of ``y`` is also traced. If we want to see a concrete value while
  debugging, and avoid the tracer too, we can use the :py:func:`disable_jit`
  context manager:

  >>> import jax
  >>>
  >>> with jax.disable_jit():
  ...   print(f(jax.numpy.array([1, 2, 3])))
  ...
  Value of y is [2 4 6]

  Args:
    fun: Function from which to form XLA computations.
    static_argnums: See the :py:func:`jax.jit` docstring.
    axis_env: Optional, a sequence of pairs where the first element is an axis
      name and the second element is a positive integer representing the size of
      the mapped axis with that name. This parameter is useful when lowering
      functions that involve parallel communication collectives, and it

    out_parts: Optional, how each output of ``fun`` should be partitioned or

    backend: This is an experimental feature and the API is likely to change.
      Optional, a string representing the XLA backend: ``\'cpu\'``, ``\'gpu\'``, or
      ``\'tpu\'``.
    tuple_args: Optional bool, defaults to ``False``. If ``True``, the resulting
      XLA computation will have a single tuple argument that is unpacked into
      the specified function arguments. If `None`, tupling will be enabled when
      there are more than 100 arguments, since some platforms have limits on
      argument arity.
    instantiate_const_outputs: Deprecated argument, does nothing.
    return_shape: Optional boolean, defaults to ``False``. If ``True``, the
      wrapped function returns a pair where the first element is the XLA
      computation and the second element is a pytree with the same structure as
      the output of ``fun`` and where the leaves are objects with ``shape``,
      ``dtype``, and ``named_shape`` attributes representing the corresponding
      types of the output leaves.
    donate_argnums: Specify which arguments are "donated" to the computation.
      It is safe to donate arguments if you no longer need them once the
      computation has finished. In some cases XLA can make use of donated
      buffers to reduce the amount of memory needed to perform a computation,
      for example recycling one of your input buffers to store a result. You
      should not reuse buffers that you donate to a computation, JAX will raise
      an error if you try to.

  Returns:
    A wrapped version of ``fun`` that when applied to example arguments returns
    a built XLA Computation (see xla_client.py), from which representations of
    the unoptimized XLA HLO computation can be extracted using methods like
    ``as_hlo_text``, ``as_serialized_hlo_module_proto``, and
    ``as_hlo_dot_graph``. If the argument ``return_shape`` is ``True``, then the
    wrapped function returns a pair where the first element is the XLA
    Computation and the second element is a pytree representing the structure,
    shapes, dtypes, and named shapes of the output of ``fun``.

    Concrete example arguments are not always necessary. For those arguments not
    indicated by ``static_argnums``, any object with ``shape`` and ``dtype``
    attributes is acceptable (excepting namedtuples, which are treated as Python
    containers).

  For example:

  >>> import jax
  >>>
  >>> def f(x): return jax.numpy.sin(jax.numpy.cos(x))
  >>> c = jax.xla_computation(f)(3.)
  >>> print(c.as_hlo_text())  # doctest: +SKIP

  Alternatively, the assignment to ``c`` above could be written:

  Here\'s an example that involves a parallel collective and axis name:

  :py:func:`hessian` is a generalization of the usual definition of the Hessian
  that supports nested Python containers (i.e. pytrees) as inputs and outputs.
  The tree structure of ``jax.hessian(fun)(x)`` is given by forming a tree
  product of the structure of ``fun(x)`` with a tree product of two copies of
  the structure of ``x``. A tree product of two tree structures is formed by
  replacing each leaf of the first tree with a copy of the second. For example:

  >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
  >>> f = lambda dct: {"c": jnp.power(dct["a"], dct["b"])}
  >>> print(jax.hessian(f)({"a": jnp.arange(2.) + 1., "b": jnp.arange(2.) + 2.}))
  {\'c\': {\'a\': {\'a\': Array([[[ 2.,  0.], [ 0.,  0.]],
                           [[ 0.,  0.], [ 0., 12.]]], dtype=float32),
               \'b\': Array([[[ 1.      ,  0.      ], [ 0.      ,  0.      ]],
                           [[ 0.      ,  0.      ], [ 0.      , 12.317766]]], dtype=float32)},
         \'b\': {\'a\': Array([[[ 1.      ,  0.      ], [ 0.      ,  0.      ]],
                           [[ 0.      ,  0.      ], [ 0.      , 12.317766]]], dtype=float32),
               \'b\': Array([[[0.      , 0.      ], [0.      , 0.      ]],
                           [[0.      , 0.      ], [0.      , 3.843624]]], dtype=float32)}}}

  Thus each leaf in the tree structure of ``jax.hessian(fun)(x)`` corresponds to
  a leaf of ``fun(x)`` and a pair of leaves of ``x``. For each leaf in
  ``jax.hessian(fun)(x)``, if the corresponding array leaf of ``fun(x)`` has
  shape ``(out_1, out_2, ...)`` and the corresponding array leaves of ``x`` have
  shape ``(in_1_1, in_1_2, ...)`` and ``(in_2_1, in_2_2, ...)`` respectively,
  then the Hessian leaf has shape ``(out_1, out_2, ..., in_1_1, in_1_2, ...,
  in_2_1, in_2_2, ...)``. In other words, the Python tree structure represents
  the block structure of the Hessian, with blocks determined by the input and
  output pytrees.

  In particular, an array is produced (with no pytrees involved) when the
  function input ``x`` and output ``fun(x)`` are each a single array, as in the
  ``g`` example above. If ``fun(x)`` has shape ``(out1, out2, ...)`` and ``x``
  has shape ``(in1, in2, ...)`` then ``jax.hessian(fun)(x)`` has shape
  ``(out1, out2, ..., in1, in2, ..., in1, in2, ...)``. To flatten pytrees into
  1D vectors, consider using :py:func:`jax.flatten_util.flatten_pytree`.

    """Vectorizing map. Creates a function which maps ``fun`` over argument axes.

  Args:
    fun: Function to be mapped over additional axes.
    in_axes: An integer, None, or (nested) standard Python container
      (tuple/list/dict) thereof specifying which input array axes to map over.

      If each positional argument to ``fun`` is an array, then ``in_axes`` can
      be an integer, a None, or a tuple of integers and Nones with length equal
      to the number of positional arguments to ``fun``. An integer or ``None``
      indicates which array axis to map over for all arguments (with ``None``
      indicating not to map any axis), and a tuple indicates which axis to map
      for each corresponding positional argument. Axis integers must be in the
      range ``[-ndim, ndim)`` for each array, where ``ndim`` is the number of
      dimensions (axes) of the corresponding input array.

      If the positional arguments to ``fun`` are container (pytree) types, the
      corresponding element of ``in_axes`` can itself be a matching container,
      so that distinct array axes can be mapped for different container
      elements. ``in_axes`` must be a container tree prefix of the positional
      argument tuple passed to ``fun``. See this link for more detail:
      https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html#applying-optional-parameters-to-pytrees

      Either ``axis_size`` must be provided explicitly, or at least one
      positional argument must have ``in_axes`` not None. The sizes of the
      mapped input axes for all mapped positional arguments must all be equal.

      Arguments passed as keywords are always mapped over their leading axis
      (i.e. axis index 0).

      See below for examples.

    out_axes: An integer, None, or (nested) standard Python container
      (tuple/list/dict) thereof indicating where the mapped axis should appear
      in the output. All outputs with a mapped axis must have a non-None
      ``out_axes`` specification. Axis integers must be in the range ``[-ndim,
      ndim)`` for each output array, where ``ndim`` is the number of dimensions
      (axes) of the array returned by the :func:`vmap`-ed function, which is one
      more than the number of dimensions (axes) of the corresponding array
      returned by ``fun``.
    axis_name: Optional, a hashable Python object used to identify the mapped
      axis so that parallel collectives can be applied.
    axis_size: Optional, an integer indicating the size of the axis to be
      mapped. If not provided, the mapped axis size is inferred from arguments.

  Returns:
    Batched/vectorized version of ``fun`` with arguments that correspond to
    those of ``fun``, but with extra array axes at positions indicated by
    ``in_axes``, and a return value that corresponds to that of ``fun``, but
    with extra array axes at positions indicated by ``out_axes``.

  For example, we can implement a matrix-matrix product using a vector dot
  product:

  >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
  >>>
  >>> vv = lambda x, y: jnp.vdot(x, y)  #  ([a], [a]) -> []
  >>> mv = vmap(vv, (0, None), 0)      #  ([b,a], [a]) -> [b]      (b is the mapped axis)
  >>> mm = vmap(mv, (None, 1), 1)      #  ([b,a], [a,c]) -> [b,c]  (c is the mapped axis)

  Here we use ``[a,b]`` to indicate an array with shape (a,b). Here are some
  variants:

  >>> mv1 = vmap(vv, (0, 0), 0)   #  ([b,a], [b,a]) -> [b]        (b is the mapped axis)
  >>> mv2 = vmap(vv, (0, 1), 0)   #  ([b,a], [a,b]) -> [b]        (b is the mapped axis)
  >>> mm2 = vmap(mv2, (1, 1), 0)  #  ([b,c,a], [a,c,b]) -> [c,b]  (c is the mapped axis)

  Here's an example of using container types in ``in_axes`` to specify which
  axes of the container elements to map over:

  >>> A, B, C, D = 2, 3, 4, 5
  >>> x = jnp.ones((A, B))
  >>> y = jnp.ones((B, C))
  >>> z = jnp.ones((C, D))
  >>> def foo(tree_arg):
  ...   x, (y, z) = tree_arg
  ...   return jnp.dot(x, jnp.dot(y, z))
  >>> tree = (x, (y, z))
  >>> print(foo(tree))
  [[12. 12. 12. 12. 12.]
   [12. 12. 12. 12. 12.]]
  >>> from jax import vmap
  >>> K = 6  # batch size
  >>> x = jnp.ones((K, A, B))  # batch axis in different locations
  >>> y = jnp.ones((B, K, C))
  >>> z = jnp.ones((C, D, K))
  >>> tree = (x, (y, z))
  >>> vfoo = vmap(foo, in_axes=((0, (1, 2)),))
  >>> print(vfoo(tree).shape)
  (6, 2, 5)

  Here's another example using container types in ``in_axes``, this time a
  dictionary, to specify the elements of the container to map over:

  >>> dct = {'a': 0., 'b': jnp.arange(5.)}
  >>> x = 1.
  >>> def foo(dct, x):
  ...  return dct['a'] + dct['b'] + x
  >>> out = vmap(foo, in_axes=({'a': None, 'b': 0}, None))(dct, x)
  >>> print(out)
  [1. 2. 3. 4. 5.]

  The results of a vectorized function can be mapped or unmapped. For example,
  the function below returns a pair with the first element mapped and the second
  unmapped. Only for unmapped results we can specify ``out_axes`` to be ``None``
  (to keep it unmapped).

  >>> print(vmap(lambda x, y: (x + y, y * 2.), in_axes=(0, None), out_axes=(0, None))(jnp.arange(2.), 4.))
  (Array([4., 5.], dtype=float32), 8.0)

  If the ``out_axes`` is specified for an unmapped result, the result is
  broadcast across the mapped axis:

  >>> print(vmap(lambda x, y: (x + y, y * 2.), in_axes=(0, None), out_axes=0)(jnp.arange(2.), 4.))
  (Array([4., 5.], dtype=float32), Array([8., 8.], dtype=float32, weak_type=True))

  If the ``out_axes`` is specified for a mapped result, the result is transposed
  accordingly.

  Finally, here's an example using ``axis_name`` together with collectives:

  >>> xs = jnp.arange(3. * 4.).reshape(3, 4)
  >>> print(vmap(lambda x: lax.psum(x, 'i'), axis_name='i')(xs))
  [[12. 15. 18. 21.]
   [12. 15. 18. 21.]
   [12. 15. 18. 21.]]

  See the :py:func:`jax.pmap` docstring for more examples involving collectives.

    '''Parallel map with support for collective operations.

  The purpose of :py:func:`pmap` is to express single-program multiple-data
  (SPMD) programs. Applying :py:func:`pmap` to a function will compile the
  function with XLA (similarly to :py:func:`jit`), then execute it in parallel
  on XLA devices, such as multiple GPUs or multiple TPU cores. Semantically it
  is comparable to :py:func:`vmap` because both transformations map a function
  over array axes, but where :py:func:`vmap` vectorizes functions by pushing the
  mapped axis down into primitive operations, :py:func:`pmap` instead replicates
  the function and executes each replica on its own XLA device in parallel.

  The mapped axis size must be less than or equal to the number of local XLA
  devices available, as returned by :py:func:`jax.local_device_count()` (unless
  ``devices`` is specified, see below). For nested :py:func:`pmap` calls, the
  product of the mapped axis sizes must be less than or equal to the number of
  XLA devices.

  .. note::
    :py:func:`pmap` compiles ``fun``, so while it can be combined with
    :py:func:`jit`, it\'s usually unnecessary.

  :py:func:`pmap` requires that all of the participating devices are identical.
  For example, it is not possible to use :py:func:`pmap` to parallelize a
  computation across two different models of GPU. It is currently an error for
  the same device to participate twice in the same `pmap`.

  **Multi-process platforms:** On multi-process platforms such as TPU pods,
  :py:func:`pmap` is designed to be used in SPMD Python programs, where every
  process is running the same Python code such that all processes run the same
  pmapped function in the same order. Each process should still call the pmapped
  function with mapped axis size equal to the number of *local* devices (unless
  ``devices`` is specified, see below), and an array of the same leading axis
  size will be returned as usual. However, any collective operations in ``fun``
  will be computed over *all* participating devices, including those on other
  processes, via device-to-device communication.  Conceptually, this can be
  thought of as running a pmap over a single array sharded across processes,
  where each process "sees" only its local shard of the input and output. The
  SPMD model requires that the same multi-process pmaps must be run in the same
  order on all devices, but they can be interspersed with arbitrary operations
  running in a single process.

  Args:
    fun: Function to be mapped over argument axes. Its arguments and return
      value should be arrays, scalars, or (nested) standard Python containers
      (tuple/list/dict) thereof. Positional arguments indicated by
      ``static_broadcasted_argnums`` can be anything at all, provided they are
      hashable and have an equality operation defined.
    axis_name: Optional, a hashable Python object used to identify the mapped
      axis so that parallel collectives can be applied.
    in_axes: A non-negative integer, None, or nested Python container thereof
      that specifies which axes of positional arguments to map over. Arguments
      passed as keywords are always mapped over their leading axis (i.e. axis
      index 0). See :py:func:`vmap` for details.
    out_axes: A non-negative integer, None, or nested Python container thereof
      indicating where the mapped axis should appear in the output. All outputs
      with a mapped axis must have a non-None ``out_axes`` specification
      (see :py:func:`vmap`).
    static_broadcasted_argnums: An int or collection of ints specifying which
      positional arguments to treat as static (compile-time constant).
      Operations that only depend on static arguments will be constant-folded.
      Calling the pmapped function with different values for these constants
      will trigger recompilation. If the pmapped function is called with fewer
      positional arguments than indicated by ``static_argnums`` then an error is
      raised. Each of the static arguments will be broadcasted to all devices.
      Arguments that are not arrays or containers thereof must be marked as
      static. Defaults to ().

      Static arguments must be hashable, meaning both ``__hash__`` and
      ``__eq__`` are implemented, and should be immutable.

    devices: This is an experimental feature and the API is likely to change.
      Optional, a sequence of Devices to map over. (Available devices can be
      retrieved via jax.devices()). Must be given identically for each process
      in multi-process settings (and will therefore include devices across
      processes). If specified, the size of the mapped axis must be equal to
      the number of devices in the sequence local to the given process. Nested
      :py:func:`pmap` s with ``devices`` specified in either the inner or outer
      :py:func:`pmap` are not yet supported.
    backend: This is an experimental feature and the API is likely to change.
      Optional, a string representing the XLA backend. \'cpu\', \'gpu\', or \'tpu\'.
    axis_size: Optional; the size of the mapped axis.
    donate_argnums: Specify which positional argument buffers are "donated" to
      the computation. It is safe to donate argument buffers if you no longer need
      them once the computation has finished. In some cases XLA can make use of
      donated buffers to reduce the amount of memory needed to perform a
      computation, for example recycling one of your input buffers to store a
      result. You should not reuse buffers that you donate to a computation, JAX
      will raise an error if you try to.
      Note that donate_argnums only work for positional arguments, and keyword
      arguments will not be donated.

      For more details on buffer donation see the
      `FAQ <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#buffer-donation>`_.

  Returns:
    A parallelized version of ``fun`` with arguments that correspond to those of
    ``fun`` but with extra array axes at positions indicated by ``in_axes`` and
    with output that has an additional leading array axis (with the same size).

  For example, assuming 8 XLA devices are available, :py:func:`pmap` can be used
  as a map along a leading array axis:

  >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
  >>>
  >>> out = pmap(lambda x: x ** 2)(jnp.arange(8))  # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> print(out)  # doctest: +SKIP
  [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]

  When the leading dimension is smaller than the number of available devices JAX
  will simply run on a subset of devices:

  >>> x = jnp.arange(3 * 2 * 2.).reshape((3, 2, 2))
  >>> y = jnp.arange(3 * 2 * 2.).reshape((3, 2, 2)) ** 2
  >>> out = pmap(jnp.dot)(x, y)  # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> print(out)  # doctest: +SKIP
  [[[    4.     9.]
    [   12.    29.]]
   [[  244.   345.]
    [  348.   493.]]
   [[ 1412.  1737.]
    [ 1740.  2141.]]]

  If your leading dimension is larger than the number of available devices you
  will get an error:

  >>> pmap(lambda x: x ** 2)(jnp.arange(9))  # doctest: +SKIP
  ValueError: ... requires 9 replicas, but only 8 XLA devices are available

  As with :py:func:`vmap`, using ``None`` in ``in_axes`` indicates that an
  argument doesn\'t have an extra axis and should be broadcasted, rather than
  mapped, across the replicas:

  >>> x, y = jnp.arange(2.), 4.
  >>> out = pmap(lambda x, y: (x + y, y * 2.), in_axes=(0, None))(x, y)  # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> print(out)  # doctest: +SKIP
  ([4., 5.], [8., 8.])

  Note that :py:func:`pmap` always returns values mapped over their leading axis,
  equivalent to using ``out_axes=0`` in :py:func:`vmap`.

  In addition to expressing pure maps, :py:func:`pmap` can also be used to express
  parallel single-program multiple-data (SPMD) programs that communicate via
  collective operations. For example:

  >>> f = lambda x: x / jax.lax.psum(x, axis_name=\'i\')
  >>> out = pmap(f, axis_name=\'i\')(jnp.arange(4.))  # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> print(out)  # doctest: +SKIP
  [ 0.          0.16666667  0.33333334  0.5       ]
  >>> print(out.sum())  # doctest: +SKIP
  1.0

  In this example, ``axis_name`` is a string, but it can be any Python object
  with ``__hash__`` and ``__eq__`` defined.

  The argument ``axis_name`` to :py:func:`pmap` names the mapped axis so that
  collective operations, like :func:`jax.lax.psum`, can refer to it. Axis names
  are important particularly in the case of nested :py:func:`pmap` functions,
  where collective operations can operate over distinct axes:

  >>> from functools import partial
  >>> import jax
  >>>
  >>> @partial(pmap, axis_name=\'rows\')
  ... @partial(pmap, axis_name=\'cols\')
  ... def normalize(x):
  ...   row_normed = x / jax.lax.psum(x, \'rows\')
  ...   col_normed = x / jax.lax.psum(x, \'cols\')
  ...   doubly_normed = x / jax.lax.psum(x, (\'rows\', \'cols\'))
  ...   return row_normed, col_normed, doubly_normed
  >>>
  >>> x = jnp.arange(8.).reshape((4, 2))
  >>> row_normed, col_normed, doubly_normed = normalize(x)  # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> print(row_normed.sum(0))  # doctest: +SKIP
  [ 1.  1.]
  >>> print(col_normed.sum(1))  # doctest: +SKIP
  [ 1.  1.  1.  1.]
  >>> print(doubly_normed.sum((0, 1)))  # doctest: +SKIP
  1.0

  On multi-process platforms, collective operations operate over all devices,
  including those on other processes. For example, assuming the following code
  runs on two processes with 4 XLA devices each:

  >>> f = lambda x: x + jax.lax.psum(x, axis_name=\'i\')
  >>> data = jnp.arange(4) if jax.process_index() == 0 else jnp.arange(4, 8)
  >>> out = pmap(f, axis_name=\'i\')(data)  # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> print(out)  # doctest: +SKIP
  [28 29 30 31] # on process 0
  [32 33 34 35] # on process 1

  Each process passes in a different length-4 array, corresponding to its 4
  local devices, and the psum operates over all 8 values. Conceptually, the two
  length-4 arrays can be thought of as a sharded length-8 array (in this example
  equivalent to jnp.arange(8)) that is mapped over, with the length-8 mapped
  axis given name \'i\'. The pmap call on each process then returns the
  corresponding length-4 output shard.

  The ``devices`` argument can be used to specify exactly which devices are used
  to run the parallel computation. For example, again assuming a single process
  with 8 devices, the following code defines two parallel computations, one
  which runs on the first six devices and one on the remaining two:

  >>> from functools import partial
  >>> @partial(pmap, axis_name=\'i\', devices=jax.devices()[:6])
  ... def f1(x):
  ...   return x / jax.lax.psum(x, axis_name=\'i\')
  >>>

  Args:
    fun: Function to be differentiated. Its arguments should be arrays, scalars,
      or standard Python containers of arrays or scalars. It should return an
      array, scalar, or standard Python container of arrays or scalars.
    primals: The primal values at which the Jacobian of ``fun`` should be
      evaluated. Should be either a tuple or a list of arguments,
      and its length should be equal to the number of positional parameters of
      ``fun``.
    tangents: The tangent vector for which the Jacobian-vector product should be
      evaluated. Should be either a tuple or a list of tangents, with the same
      tree structure and array shapes as ``primals``.
    has_aux: Optional, bool. Indicates whether ``fun`` returns a pair where the
     first element is considered the output of the mathematical function to be
     differentiated and the second element is auxiliary data. Default False.

  Returns:
    If ``has_aux`` is ``False``, returns a ``(primals_out, tangents_out)`` pair,
    where ``primals_out`` is ``fun(*primals)``,
    and ``tangents_out`` is the Jacobian-vector product of

    ``primals_out``. If ``has_aux`` is ``True``, returns a
    ``(primals_out, tangents_out, aux)`` tuple where ``aux``
    is the auxiliary data returned by ``fun``.

  For linear functions, this transformation is equivalent to :py:func:`vjp`, but

  The outputs of the transposed function will always have the exact same dtypes
  as ``primals``, even if some values are truncated (e.g., from complex to
  float, or from float64 to float32). To avoid truncation, use dtypes in
  ``primals`` that match the full range of desired outputs from the transposed
  function. Integer dtypes are not supported.

  Args:
    fun: the linear function to be transposed.
    *primals: a positional argument tuple of arrays, scalars, or (nested)
      standard Python containers (tuples, lists, dicts, namedtuples, i.e.,
      pytrees) of those types used for evaluating the shape/dtype of
      ``fun(*primals)``. These arguments may be real scalars/ndarrays, but that
      is not required: only the ``shape`` and ``dtype`` attributes are accessed.
      See below for an example. (Note that the duck-typed objects cannot be
      namedtuples because those are treated as standard Python containers.)
    reduce_axes: Optional, tuple of axis names. If an axis is listed here, and
      ``fun`` implicitly broadcasts a value over that axis, the backward pass
      will perform a ``psum`` of the corresponding cotangent. Otherwise, the
      transposed function will be per-example over named axes. For example, if

      the batch while ``linear_transpose(f, args)`` will create a per-example

  Returns:
    A callable that calculates the transpose of ``fun``. Valid input into this
