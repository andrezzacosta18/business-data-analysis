def svd(a: Any, full_matrices: bool, compute_uv: bool = True, hermitian: bool = False, max_iterations: int = 10) -> Any | Sequence[Any]:
    """Singular value decomposition.

  Args:
    a: A matrix of shape `m x n`.
    full_matrices: If True, `u` and `vh` have the shapes `m x m` and `n x n`,
      respectively. If False, the shapes are `m x k` and `k x n`, respectively,
      where `k = min(m, n)`.
    compute_uv: Whether to compute also `u` and `v` in addition to `s`.
    hermitian: True if `a` is Hermitian.
    max_iterations: The predefined maximum number of iterations of QDWH.

  Returns:
    A 3-tuple (`u`, `s`, `vh`), where `u` and `vh` are unitary matrices,
    `s` is vector of length `k` containing the singular values in the
    non-increasing order, and `k = min(m, n)`. The shapes of `u` and `vh`
    depend on the value of `full_matrices`. For `compute_uv=False`,
    only `s` is returned.
