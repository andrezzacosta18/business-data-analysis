def delayed(function):

    This alternative to `joblib.delayed` is meant to be used in conjunction
    with `sklearn.utils.parallel.Parallel`. The latter captures the the scikit-
    learn configuration by calling `sklearn.get_config()` in the current
    thread, prior to dispatching the first task. The captured configuration is
    then propagated and enabled for the duration of the execution of the
    delayed function in the joblib workers.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.3
       `delayed` was moved from `sklearn.utils.fixes` to `sklearn.utils.parallel`
       in scikit-learn 1.3.

    Parameters
    ----------
    function : callable
        The function to be delayed.

    Returns
    -------
    output: tuple
        Tuple containing the delayed function, the positional arguments, and the
        keyword arguments.
