    Provides a general-case interface for Requests sessions to contact HTTP and

    usually be created by the :class:`Session <Session>` class under the
    covers.

    :param pool_connections: The number of urllib3 connection pools to cache.

    :param max_retries: The maximum number of retries each connection

        made it to the server. By default, Requests does not retry failed
