        Return a dict (`SSHConfigDict`) of config options for a given hostname.

        The host-matching rules of OpenSSH\'s ``ssh_config`` man page are used:
        For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.  The
        configuration files contain sections separated by ``Host`` and/or
        ``Match`` specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts
        which match the given patterns or keywords

        Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more host-
        specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the file,
        and general defaults at the end.

        The keys in the returned dict are all normalized to lowercase (look for
        ``"port"``, not ``"Port"``. The values are processed according to the
        rules for substitution variable expansion in ``ssh_config``.

        Finally, please see the docs for `SSHConfigDict` for deeper info on
        features such as optional type conversion methods, e.g.::

            conf = my_config.lookup(\'myhost\')
            assert conf[\'passwordauthentication\'] == \'yes\'
            assert conf.as_bool(\'passwordauthentication\') is True

        .. note::
            If there is no explicitly configured ``HostName`` value, it will be
            set to the being-looked-up hostname, which is as close as we can
            get to OpenSSH\'s behavior around that particular option.

class SSHConfigDict(dict):
    """
    A dictionary wrapper/subclass for per-host configuration structures.

    This class introduces some usage niceties for consumers of `SSHConfig`,
    specifically around the issue of variable type conversions: normal value
    access yields strings, but there are now methods such as `as_bool` and
    `as_int` that yield casted values instead.

    For example, given the following ``ssh_config`` file snippet::

        Host foo.example.com
            PasswordAuthentication no
            Compression yes
            ServerAliveInterval 60

    the following code highlights how you can access the raw strings as well as
    usefully Python type-casted versions (recalling that keys are all
    normalized to lowercase first)::

        my_config = SSHConfig()
        my_config.parse(open('~/.ssh/config'))
        conf = my_config.lookup('foo.example.com')

        assert conf['passwordauthentication'] == 'no'
        assert conf.as_bool('passwordauthentication') is False
        assert conf['compression'] == 'yes'
        assert conf.as_bool('compression') is True
        assert conf['serveraliveinterval'] == '60'
        assert conf.as_int('serveraliveinterval') == 60

        which are either ``"yes"`` or ``"no"``. In such cases, ``"yes"`` yields
        ``True`` and any other value becomes ``False``.

        .. note::
            If (for whatever reason) the stored value is already boolean in
            nature, it\'s simply returned.
