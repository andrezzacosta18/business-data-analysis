    An SSH2 message is a stream of bytes that encodes some combination of
    strings, integers, bools, and infinite-precision integers.  This class
    builds or breaks down such a byte stream.

    Normally you don't need to deal with anything this low-level, but it's
    exposed for people implementing custom extensions, or features that
    paramiko doesn't support yet.
