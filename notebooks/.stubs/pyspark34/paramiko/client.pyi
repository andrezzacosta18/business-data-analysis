class SSHClient(ClosingContextManager):
    """
    A high-level representation of a session with an SSH server.  This class
    wraps `.Transport`, `.Channel`, and `.SFTPClient` to take care of most
    aspects of authenticating and opening channels.  A typical use case is::

        client = SSHClient()
        client.load_system_host_keys()
        client.connect('ssh.example.com')
        stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command('ls -l')

    You may pass in explicit overrides for authentication and server host key
    checking.  The default mechanism is to try to use local key files or an
    SSH agent (if one is running).

    Instances of this class may be used as context managers.

        Connect to an SSH server and authenticate to it.  The server\'s host key
        is checked against the system host keys (see `load_system_host_keys`)
        and any local host keys (`load_host_keys`).  If the server\'s hostname
        is not found in either set of host keys, the missing host key policy
        is used (see `set_missing_host_key_policy`).  The default policy is
        to reject the key and raise an `.SSHException`.

        Authentication is attempted in the following order of priority:

            - The ``pkey`` or ``key_filename`` passed in (if any)

              - ``key_filename`` may contain OpenSSH public certificate paths
                as well as regular private-key paths; when files ending in
                ``-cert.pub`` are found, they are assumed to match a private
                key, and both components will be loaded. (The private key
                itself does *not* need to be listed in ``key_filename`` for
                this to occur - *just* the certificate.)

            - Any key we can find through an SSH agent
            - Any "id_rsa", "id_dsa" or "id_ecdsa" key discoverable in
              ``~/.ssh/``

              - When OpenSSH-style public certificates exist that match an
                existing such private key (so e.g. one has ``id_rsa`` and
                ``id_rsa-cert.pub``) the certificate will be loaded alongside
                the private key and used for authentication.

            - Plain username/password auth, if a password was given

        If a private key requires a password to unlock it, and a password is
        passed in, that password will be used to attempt to unlock the key.

        :param str hostname: the server to connect to
        :param int port: the server port to connect to

            an optional callable which is handed a subset of the constructor
