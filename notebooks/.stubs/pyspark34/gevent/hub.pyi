    Create a new :class:`greenlet.greenlet` object and schedule it to
    run ``function(*args, **kwargs)``.

    This returns a raw :class:`~greenlet.greenlet` which does not have all the useful
    methods that :class:`gevent.Greenlet` has. Typically, applications
    should prefer :func:`~gevent.spawn`, but this method may
    occasionally be useful as an optimization if there are many
    greenlets involved.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.1a3
        Verify that ``function`` is callable, raising a TypeError if not. Previously,
        the spawned greenlet would have failed the first time it was switched to.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.1b1

       instead of spawning a greenlet that will raise an uncaught TypeError.

        documented. Note that this may incur an additional expense.

       attributes of the returned greenlet.

       if ``GEVENT_TRACK_GREENLET_TREE`` is enabled (the default). If not enabled,
       those attributes will not be set.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.5a3
       The returned greenlet always has a *loop* attribute matching the
       current hub's loop. This helps it work better with more gevent APIs.

    Put the current greenlet to sleep for at least *seconds*.

    *seconds* may be specified as an integer, or a float if fractional
    seconds are desired.

    .. tip:: In the current implementation, a value of 0 (the default)
       means to yield execution to any other runnable greenlets, but
       this greenlet may be scheduled again before the event loop
       cycles (in an extreme case, a greenlet that repeatedly sleeps
       with 0 can prevent greenlets that are ready to do I/O from
       being scheduled for some (small) period of time); a value greater than
       0, on the other hand, will delay running this greenlet until
       the next iteration of the loop.

    If *ref* is False, the greenlet running ``sleep()`` will not prevent :func:`gevent.wait`
    from exiting.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.3a1

        The method :meth:`Greenlet.kill` method does the same and
        more (and the same caveats listed there apply here). However, the MAIN
        greenlet - the one that exists initially - does not have a
        ``kill()`` method, and neither do any created with :func:`spawn_raw`,
        so you have to use this function.

    .. caution:: Use care when killing greenlets. If they are not prepared for
       exceptions, this could result in corrupted state.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.1a2
        If the ``greenlet`` has a :meth:`kill <Greenlet.kill>` method, calls it. This prevents a

    signal_handler(signalnum, handler, *args, **kwargs) -> object

    Call the *handler* with the *args* and *kwargs* when the process

    The *handler* will be run in a new greenlet when the signal is
    delivered.

    This returns an object with the useful method ``cancel``, which,
    when called, will prevent future deliveries of *signalnum* from
    calling *handler*. It's best to keep the returned object alive
    until you call ``cancel``.

        This may not operate correctly with ``SIGCHLD`` if libev child

    process, symptoms may include hanging of functions like
    :func:`socket.getaddrinfo`, and the hub\'s threadpool is unlikely

       this function (and thus ``gevent.os.fork``) return. If they have

       You can force this by inserting a few small (but non-zero) calls to :func:`sleep`
       after fork returns. (As of gevent 1.1 and before, fork watchers will
       not have run, but this may change in the future.)
