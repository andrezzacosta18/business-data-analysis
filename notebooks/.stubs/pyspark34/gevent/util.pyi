    Helper to make function return an exception, rather than raise it.

    Because every exception that is unhandled by greenlet will be logged,
    it is desirable to prevent non-error exceptions from leaving a greenlet.
    This can done with a simple ``try/except`` construct::

        def wrapped_func(*args, **kwargs):
            try:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)

                return ex

    This class provides a shortcut to write that in one line::

        wrapped_func = wrap_errors((TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError), func)

    It also preserves ``__str__`` and ``__repr__`` of the original function.
