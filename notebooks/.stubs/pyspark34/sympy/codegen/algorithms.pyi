def newtons_method(expr, wrt, atol: float = 1e-12, delta: Incomplete | None = None, debug: bool = False, itermax: Incomplete | None = None, counter: Incomplete | None = None):
    """ Generates an AST for Newton-Raphson method (a root-finding algorithm).

    Explanation
    ===========

    Returns an abstract syntax tree (AST) based on ``sympy.codegen.ast`` for Netwon's
    method of root-finding.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : expression
    wrt : Symbol
        With respect to, i.e. what is the variable.
    atol : number or expr
        Absolute tolerance (stopping criterion)
    delta : Symbol
        Will be a ``Dummy`` if ``None``.
    debug : bool
        Whether to print convergence information during iterations
    itermax : number or expr
        Maximum number of iterations.
    counter : Symbol
        Will be a ``Dummy`` if ``None``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols, cos
    >>> from sympy.codegen.ast import Assignment
    >>> from sympy.codegen.algorithms import newtons_method
    >>> x, dx, atol = symbols('x dx atol')
    >>> expr = cos(x) - x**3
    >>> algo = newtons_method(expr, x, atol, dx)
    >>> algo.has(Assignment(dx, -expr/expr.diff(x)))
    True

    """ Generates an AST for a function implementing the Newton-Raphson method.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : expression
    wrt : Symbol
        With respect to, i.e. what is the variable
    params : iterable of symbols
        Symbols appearing in expr that are taken as constants during the iterations
        (these will be accepted as parameters to the generated function).
    func_name : str
        Name of the generated function.
    attrs : Tuple
        Attribute instances passed as ``attrs`` to ``FunctionDefinition``.
    \\*\\*kwargs :
        Keyword arguments passed to :func:`sympy.codegen.algorithms.newtons_method`.
