class LatticeOp(AssocOp):

    Join/meet operations of an algebraic lattice[1].

    Explanation
    ===========

    These binary operations are associative (op(op(a, b), c) = op(a, op(b, c))),
    commutative (op(a, b) = op(b, a)) and idempotent (op(a, a) = op(a) = a).
    Common examples are AND, OR, Union, Intersection, max or min. They have an
    identity element (op(identity, a) = a) and an absorbing element
    conventionally called zero (op(zero, a) = zero).

    This is an abstract base class, concrete derived classes must declare
    attributes zero and identity. All defining properties are then respected.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Integer
    >>> from sympy.core.operations import LatticeOp
    >>> class my_join(LatticeOp):
    ...     zero = Integer(0)
    ...     identity = Integer(1)
    >>> my_join(2, 3) == my_join(3, 2)
    True
    >>> my_join(2, my_join(3, 4)) == my_join(2, 3, 4)
    True
    >>> my_join(0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4)

    >>> my_join(1, 2)

    .. notes::
       This approach is experimental, and can be replaced or deleted in the future.

    Explanation
    ===========

    If arguments of different types are passed, the classes which handle the operation for each type
    are collected. Then, a class which performs the operation is selected by recursive binary dispatching.
    Dispatching relation can be registered by ``register_handlerclass`` method.

    Priority registration is unordered. You cannot make ``A*B`` and ``B*A`` refer to
    different handler classes. All logic dealing with the order of arguments must be implemented
    in the handler class.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Add, Expr, Symbol
    >>> from sympy.core.add import add

    >>> class NewExpr(Expr):
    ...     @property

    ...         return NewAdd
    >>> class NewAdd(NewExpr, Add):
    ...     pass
    >>> add.register_handlerclass((Add, NewAdd), NewAdd)

    >>> a, b = Symbol('a'), NewExpr()
    >>> add(a, b) == NewAdd(a, b)
