    """Describes a strategy to use when outputting a parse tree to a string.

    Some parts of this strategy come from the distinction between
    HTML4, HTML5, and XML. Others are configurable by the user.

    Formatters are passed in as the `formatter` argument to methods
    like `PageElement.encode`. Most people won't need to think about
    formatters, and most people who need to think about them can pass
    in one of these predefined strings as `formatter` rather than
    making a new Formatter object:

    For HTML documents:
     * 'html' - HTML entity substitution for generic HTML documents. (default)
     * 'html5' - HTML entity substitution for HTML5 documents, as
                 well as some optimizations in the way tags are rendered.
     * 'minimal' - Only make the substitutions necessary to guarantee
                   valid HTML.
     * None - Do not perform any substitution. This will be faster
              but may result in invalid markup.

    For XML documents:
     * 'html' - Entity substitution for XHTML documents.
     * 'minimal' - Only make the substitutions necessary to guarantee
                   valid XML. (default)
     * None - Do not perform any substitution. This will be faster
              but may result in invalid markup.

        :param language: This should be Formatter.XML if you are formatting
           XML markup and Formatter.HTML if you are formatting HTML markup.

        :param entity_substitution: A function to call to replace special
           characters with XML/HTML entities. For examples, see 
           bs4.dammit.EntitySubstitution.substitute_html and substitute_xml.
        :param void_element_close_prefix: By default, void elements
           are represented as <tag/> (XML rules) rather than <tag>
           (HTML rules). To get <tag>, pass in the empty string.
        :param cdata_containing_tags: The list of tags that are defined
           as containing CDATA in this dialect. For example, in HTML,
           <script> and <style> tags are defined as containing CDATA,
           and their contents should not be formatted.
        :param blank_attributes_are_booleans: Render attributes whose value
            is the empty string as HTML-style boolean attributes.
            (Attributes whose value is None are always rendered this way.)

        :param indent: If indent is a non-negative integer or string,
            then the contents of elements will be indented
            appropriately when pretty-printing. An indent level of 0,
            negative, or "" will only insert newlines. Using a
            positive integer indent indents that many spaces per
            level. If indent is a string (such as "\t"), that string
            is used to indent each level. The default behavior to
            indent one space per level.
