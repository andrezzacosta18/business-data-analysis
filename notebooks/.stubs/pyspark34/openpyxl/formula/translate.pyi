class TranslatorError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when a formula can't be translated across cells.

    This error arises when a formula's references would be translated outside
    the worksheet's bounds on the top or left. Excel represents these
    situations with a #REF! literal error. E.g., if the formula at B2 is
    '=A1', attempting to translate the formula to B1 raises TranslatorError,
    since there's no cell above A1. Similarly, translating the same formula
    from B2 to A2 raises TranslatorError, since there's no cell to the left of
    A1.
