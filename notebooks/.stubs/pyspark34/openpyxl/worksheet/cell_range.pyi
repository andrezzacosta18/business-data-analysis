    Represents a range in a sheet: title and coordinates.

    This object is used to perform operations on ranges, like:

    - shift, expand or shrink
    - union/intersection with another sheet range,

    We can check whether a range is:

    - equal or not equal to another,
    - disjoint of another,
    - contained in another.

    We can get:

    - the size of a range.
    - the range bounds (vertices)
    - the coordinates,
    - the string representation,
