    Base class for extractions from compressed archives.

    Subclasses can be used with :meth:`pooch.Pooch.fetch` and
    :func:`pooch.retrieve` to unzip a downloaded data file into a folder in the
    local data store. :meth:`~pooch.Pooch.fetch` will return a list with the
    names of the extracted files instead of the archive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    members : list or None
        If None, will unpack all files in the archive. Otherwise, *members*
        must be a list of file names to unpack from the archive. Only these
        files will be unpacked.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : str
            Full path of the zipped file in local storage.

        pooch : :class:`pooch.Pooch`
            The instance of :class:`pooch.Pooch` that is calling this.

        Returns
        -------
        fnames : list of str
            A list of the full path to all files in the extracted archive.

class Unzip(ExtractorProcessor):
    """
    Processor that unpacks a zip archive and returns a list of all files.

    Use with :meth:`pooch.Pooch.fetch` or :func:`pooch.retrieve` to unzip a
    downloaded data file into a folder in the local data store. The
    method/function will return a list with the names of the unzipped files
    instead of the zip archive.

    The output folder is ``{fname}.unzip``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    members : list or None
        If None, will unpack all files in the zip archive. Otherwise, *members*
        must be a list of file names to unpack from the archive. Only these

        If None, files will be unpacked to the default location (a folder in
        the same location as the downloaded zip file, with the suffix
        ``.unzip`` added). Otherwise, files will be unpacked to
        ``extract_dir``, which is interpreted as a *relative path* (relative to
        the cache location provided by :func:`pooch.retrieve` or
        :meth:`pooch.Pooch.fetch`).

class Untar(ExtractorProcessor):

    Processor that unpacks a tar archive and returns a list of all files.

    Use with :meth:`pooch.Pooch.fetch` or :func:`pooch.retrieve` to untar a
    downloaded data file into a folder in the local data store. The
    method/function will return a list with the names of the extracted files

class Decompress:
    '''
    Processor that decompress a file and returns the decompressed version.

    Use with :meth:`pooch.Pooch.fetch` or :func:`pooch.retrieve` to decompress
    a downloaded data file so that it can be easily opened. Useful for data
    files that take a long time to decompress (exchanging disk space for
    speed).

    Supported decompression methods are LZMA (``.xz``), bzip2 (``.bz2``), and
    gzip (``.gz``).

    File names with the standard extensions (see above) can use
    ``method="auto"`` to automatically determine the compression method. This
    can be overwritten by setting the *method* argument.

    .. note::

        To unpack zip and tar archives with one or more files, use
        :class:`pooch.Unzip` and :class:`pooch.Untar` instead.

    The output file is ``{fname}.decomp`` by default but it can be changed by
    setting the ``name`` parameter.

    .. warning::

        Passing in ``name`` can cause existing data to be lost! For example, if
        a file already exists with the specified name it will be overwritten
        with the new decompressed file content. **Use this option with
        caution.**

    Parameters
    ----------
    method : str
        Name of the compression method. Can be "auto", "lzma", "xz", "bzip2",
        or "gzip".
    name : None or str
        Defines the decompressed file name. The file name will be
        ``{fname}.decomp`` if ``None`` (default) or the given name otherwise.
        Note that the name should **not** include the full (or relative) path,
        it should be just the file name itself.
