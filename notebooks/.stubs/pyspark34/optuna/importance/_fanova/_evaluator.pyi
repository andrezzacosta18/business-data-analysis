class FanovaImportanceEvaluator(BaseImportanceEvaluator):
    """fANOVA importance evaluator.

    Implements the fANOVA hyperparameter importance evaluation algorithm in
    `An Efficient Approach for Assessing Hyperparameter Importance
    <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/hutter14.html>`_.

    Given a study, fANOVA fits a random forest regression model that predicts the objective value
    given a parameter configuration. The more accurate this model is, the more reliable the
    importances assessed by this class are.

    .. note::

        Requires the `sklearn <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>`_ Python package.

    .. note::

        Pairwise and higher order importances are not supported through this class. They can be
        computed using :class:`~optuna.importance._fanova._fanova._Fanova` directly but is not
        recommended as interfaces may change without prior notice.

    .. note::

        The performance of fANOVA depends on the prediction performance of the underlying
        random forest model. In order to obtain high prediction performance, it is necessary to
        cover a wide range of the hyperparameter search space. It is recommended to use an
        exploration-oriented sampler such as :class:`~optuna.samplers.RandomSampler`.
