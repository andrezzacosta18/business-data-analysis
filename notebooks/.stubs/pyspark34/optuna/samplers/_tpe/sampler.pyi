class TPESampler(BaseSampler):
    '''Sampler using TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) algorithm.

    This sampler is based on *independent sampling*.
    See also :class:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler` for more details of \'independent sampling\'.

    On each trial, for each parameter, TPE fits one Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) ``l(x)`` to
    the set of parameter values associated with the best objective values, and another GMM
    ``g(x)`` to the remaining parameter values. It chooses the parameter value ``x`` that
    maximizes the ratio ``l(x)/g(x)``.

    For further information about TPE algorithm, please refer to the following papers:

    - `Algorithms for Hyper-Parameter Optimization
      <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4443-algorithms-for-hyper-parameter-optimization.pdf>`_
    - `Making a Science of Model Search: Hyperparameter Optimization in Hundreds of
      Dimensions for Vision Architectures <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/bergstra13.pdf>`_

    Example:

        .. testcode::

            import optuna
            from optuna.samplers import TPESampler


            def objective(trial):
                x = trial.suggest_float("x", -10, 10)
                return x ** 2


            study = optuna.create_study(sampler=TPESampler())
            study.optimize(objective, n_trials=10)

    Args:
        consider_prior:
            Enhance the stability of Parzen estimator by imposing a Gaussian prior when
            :obj:`True`. The prior is only effective if the sampling distribution is
            either :class:`~optuna.distributions.UniformDistribution`,
            :class:`~optuna.distributions.DiscreteUniformDistribution`,
            :class:`~optuna.distributions.LogUniformDistribution`,
            :class:`~optuna.distributions.IntUniformDistribution`,
            or :class:`~optuna.distributions.IntLogUniformDistribution`.
        prior_weight:
            The weight of the prior. This argument is used in
            :class:`~optuna.distributions.UniformDistribution`,
            :class:`~optuna.distributions.DiscreteUniformDistribution`,
            :class:`~optuna.distributions.LogUniformDistribution`,
            :class:`~optuna.distributions.IntUniformDistribution`,
            :class:`~optuna.distributions.IntLogUniformDistribution`, and
            :class:`~optuna.distributions.CategoricalDistribution`.
        consider_magic_clip:
            Enable a heuristic to limit the smallest variances of Gaussians used in
            the Parzen estimator.
        consider_endpoints:
            Take endpoints of domains into account when calculating variances of Gaussians
            in Parzen estimator. See the original paper for details on the heuristics
            to calculate the variances.
        n_startup_trials:
            The random sampling is used instead of the TPE algorithm until the given number
            of trials finish in the same study.
        n_ei_candidates:
            Number of candidate samples used to calculate the expected improvement.
        gamma:
            A function that takes the number of finished trials and returns the number
            of trials to form a density function for samples with low grains.
            See the original paper for more details.
        weights:
            A function that takes the number of finished trials and returns a weight for them.
            See `Making a Science of Model Search: Hyperparameter Optimization in Hundreds of
            Dimensions for Vision Architectures <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/bergstra13.pdf>`_
            for more details.
        seed:
            Seed for random number generator.
        multivariate:
            If this is :obj:`True`, the multivariate TPE is used when suggesting parameters.
            The multivariate TPE is reported to outperform the independent TPE. See `BOHB: Robust
            and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale
            <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/falkner18a.html>`_ for more details.

            .. note::
                Added in v2.2.0 as an experimental feature. The interface may change in newer
                versions without prior notice. See
                https://github.com/optuna/optuna/releases/tag/v2.2.0.
        group:
            If this and ``multivariate`` are :obj:`True`, the multivariate TPE with the group
            decomposed search space is used when suggesting parameters.
            The sampling algorithm decomposes the search space based on past trials and samples
            from the joint distribution in each decomposed subspace.
            The decomposed subspaces are a partition of the whole search space. Each subspace
            is a maximal subset of the whole search space, which satisfies the following:
            for a trial in completed trials, the intersection of the subspace and the search space
            of the trial becomes subspace itself or an empty set.
            Sampling from the joint distribution on the subspace is realized by multivariate TPE.

            .. note::
                Added in v2.8.0 as an experimental feature. The interface may change in newer
                versions without prior notice. See

            Example:

                import optuna


                def objective(trial):
                    x = trial.suggest_categorical("x", ["A", "B"])
                    if x == "A":
                        return trial.suggest_float("y", -10, 10)
                    else:
                        return trial.suggest_int("z", -10, 10)


                sampler = optuna.samplers.TPESampler(multivariate=True, group=True)
                study = optuna.create_study(sampler=sampler)
                study.optimize(objective, n_trials=10)
        warn_independent_sampling:
            If this is :obj:`True` and ``multivariate=True``, a warning message is emitted when
            the value of a parameter is sampled by using an independent sampler.
            If ``multivariate=False``, this flag has no effect.
        constant_liar:
            If :obj:`True`, penalize running trials to avoid suggesting parameter configurations
            nearby.

            .. note::
                It is recommended to set this value to :obj:`True` during distributed
                optimization to avoid having multiple workers evaluating similar parameter
                configurations. In particular, if each objective function evaluation is costly
                and the durations of the running states are significant, and/or the number of
                workers is high.

            .. note::
