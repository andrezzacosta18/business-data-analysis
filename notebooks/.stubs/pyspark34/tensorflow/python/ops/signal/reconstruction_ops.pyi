def overlap_and_add(signal, frame_step, name: Incomplete | None = None):
    """Reconstructs a signal from a framed representation.

  Adds potentially overlapping frames of a signal with shape
  `[..., frames, frame_length]`, offsetting subsequent frames by `frame_step`.
  The resulting tensor has shape `[..., output_size]` where

      output_size = (frames - 1) * frame_step + frame_length

  Args:
    signal: A [..., frames, frame_length] `Tensor`. All dimensions may be
      unknown, and rank must be at least 2.
    frame_step: An integer or scalar `Tensor` denoting overlap offsets. Must be
      less than or equal to `frame_length`.
    name: An optional name for the operation.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` with shape `[..., output_size]` containing the overlap-added
    frames of `signal`'s inner-most two dimensions.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If `signal`'s rank is less than 2, or `frame_step` is not a
      scalar integer.
