  Batch normalization during training has multiple dynamic parameters that are

  there's an opportunity to reduce the computations down to a scale and
  addition, rather than the more expensive multiple ops, and even bake the
  scaling into the convolution weights. This function identifies the typical
  pattern of batch normalization subgraphs, and performs the transformation to
  fold the computations down into a simpler form. It currently only supports
  batch normalization that's performed by the BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization
  FusedBatchNorm and FusedBatchNormV3 ops, and will need to be extended in the
  future to handle the newer style.
