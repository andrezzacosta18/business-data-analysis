class RegressionRecipe(BaseRecipe):
    '''
    A recipe for developing high-quality regression models. The recipe is designed for
    developing models using scikit-learn and frameworks that integrate with scikit-learn,
    such as the ``XGBRegressor`` API from XGBoost. The corresponding recipe
    template repository is available at https://github.com/mlflow/recipes-regression-template.
    The training recipe contains the following sequential steps:

    **ingest** -> **split** -> **transform** -> **train** -> **evaluate** -> **register**

    while the batch scoring recipe contains this set of sequential steps:

    **ingest_scoring** -> **predict**

        '''
        Runs the full recipe or a particular recipe step, producing outputs and displaying a
        summary of results upon completion. Step outputs are cached from previous executions, and
        steps are only re-executed if configuration or code changes have been made to the step or
        to any of its dependent steps (e.g. changes to the recipe\'s ``recipe.yaml`` file or
        ``steps/ingest.py`` file) since the previous execution.

        :param step: String name of the step to run within the regression recipe. The step and
                     its dependencies are executed sequentially. If a step is not specified, the
                     entire recipe is executed. Supported steps, in their order of execution, are:

                     - ``"ingest"``: resolves the dataset specified by the ``data/training`` section
                       in the recipe\'s configuration file (``recipe.yaml``) and converts it to
                       parquet format.

                     - ``"ingest_scoring"``: resolves the dataset specified by the
                       ``ingest_scoring`` section in the recipe\'s configuration file
                       (``recipe.yaml``)and converts it to parquet format.

                     - ``"split"``: splits the ingested dataset produced by the **ingest** step into
                       a training dataset for model training, a validation dataset for model
                       performance evaluation & tuning, and a test dataset for model performance
                       evaluation.

                     - ``"transform"``: uses the training dataset created by the **split** step to
                       fit a transformer that performs the transformations defined in the
                       recipe\'s ``steps/transform.py`` file. Then, applies the transformer to the
                       training dataset and the validation dataset, creating transformed datasets
                       that are used by subsequent steps for estimator training and model
                       performance evaluation.

                     - ``"train"``: uses the transformed training dataset output from the
                       **transform** step to fit an estimator with the type and parameters defined
                       in in the recipe\'s ``steps/train.py`` file. Then, joins the estimator with
                       the fitted transformer output from the **transform** step to create a model
                       recipe. Finally, evaluates the model recipe against the transformed
                       training and validation datasets to compute performance metrics.

                     - ``"evaluate"``: evaluates the model recipe created by the **train** step
                       on the validation and test dataset outputs from the **split** step, computing
                       performance metrics and model explanations. Then, compares performance
                       metrics against thresholds configured in the recipe\'s ``recipe.yaml``
                       configuration file to compute a ``model_validation_status``, which indicates
                       whether or not the model is good enough to be registered to the MLflow Model
                       Registry by the subsequent **register** step.

                     - ``"register"``: checks the ``model_validation_status`` output of the
                       preceding **evaluate** step and, if model validation was successful (as
                       indicated by the ``\'VALIDATED\'`` status), registers the model recipe
                       created by the **train** step to the MLflow Model Registry.

                     - ``"predict"``: uses the ingested dataset for scoring created by the
                       **ingest_scoring** step and applies the specified model to the dataset.
