    Mark an active experiment for deletion. This also applies to experiment's metadata, runs and

    Experiments marked for deletion can be restored using ``restore`` command, unless they are
    permanently deleted.

    Specific implementation of deletion is dependent on backend stores. ``FileStore`` moves
    experiments marked for deletion under a ``.trash`` folder under the main folder used to
    instantiate ``FileStore``. Experiments marked for deletion can be permanently deleted by
    clearing the ``.trash`` folder. It is recommended to use a ``cron`` job or an alternate
    workflow mechanism to clear ``.trash`` folder.
