def lagrange_inversion(a):
    """Given a series

    f(x) = a[1]*x + a[2]*x**2 + ... + a[n-1]*x**(n - 1),

    use the Lagrange inversion formula to compute a series

    g(x) = b[1]*x + b[2]*x**2 + ... + b[n-1]*x**(n - 1)

    so that f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) = x mod x**n. We must have a[0] = 0, so
    necessarily b[0] = 0 too.

    The algorithm is naive and could be improved, but speed isn't an
    issue here and it's easy to read.
