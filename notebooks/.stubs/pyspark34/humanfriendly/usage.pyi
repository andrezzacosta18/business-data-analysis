    '''
    Highlight special items in a usage message.

    :param usage_text: The usage message to process (a string).
    :returns: The usage message with special items highlighted.

    This function highlights the following special items:

    - The initial line of the form "Usage: ..."
    - Short and long command line options
    - Environment variables
    - Meta variables (see :func:`find_meta_variables()`)

    All items are highlighted in the color defined by
    :data:`.HIGHLIGHT_COLOR`.
    '''
def find_meta_variables(usage_text):
    """
    Find the meta variables in the given usage message.

    :param usage_text: The usage message to parse (a string).
    :returns: A list of strings with any meta variables found in the usage
              message.

    When a command line option requires an argument, the convention is to
    format such options as ``--option=ARG``. The text ``ARG`` in this example
    is the meta variable.
    """
def parse_usage(text):
    '''
    Parse a usage message by inferring its structure (and making some assumptions :-).

    :param text: The usage message to parse (a string).
    :returns: A tuple of two lists:

              1. A list of strings with the paragraphs of the usage message\'s
                 "introduction" (the paragraphs before the documentation of the
                 supported command line options).

              2. A list of strings with pairs of command line options and their
                 descriptions: Item zero is a line listing a supported command
                 line option, item one is the description of that command line
                 option, item two is a line listing another supported command
                 line option, etc.

    Usage messages in general are free format of course, however
    :func:`parse_usage()` assume a certain structure from usage messages in
    order to successfully parse them:

    - The usage message starts with a line ``Usage: ...`` that shows a symbolic
      representation of the way the program is to be invoked.

    - After some free form text a line ``Supported options:`` (surrounded by
      empty lines) precedes the documentation of the supported command line
      options.

    - The command line options are documented as follows::

        -v, --verbose

          Make more noise.

      So all of the variants of the command line option are shown together on a
      separate line, followed by one or more paragraphs describing the option.

    - There are several other minor assumptions, but to be honest I\'m not sure if
      anyone other than me is ever going to use this functionality, so for now I
      won\'t list every intricate detail :-).

      If you\'re curious anyway, refer to the usage message of the `humanfriendly`
      package (defined in the :mod:`humanfriendly.cli` module) and compare it with
      the usage message you see when you run ``humanfriendly --help`` and the
      generated usage message embedded in the readme.

      Feel free to request more detailed documentation if you\'re interested in
      using the :mod:`humanfriendly.usage` module outside of the little ecosystem
      of Python packages that I have been building over the past years.
    '''
def render_usage(text):
    """
    Reformat a command line program's usage message to reStructuredText_.

    :param text: The plain text usage message (a string).
    :returns: The usage message rendered to reStructuredText_ (a string).
    """
def inject_usage(module_name) -> None:
    """
    Use cog_ to inject a usage message into a reStructuredText_ file.

    :param module_name: The name of the module whose ``__doc__`` attribute is
                        the source of the usage message (a string).

    This simple wrapper around :func:`render_usage()` makes it very easy to
    inject a reformatted usage message into your documentation using cog_. To
    use it you add a fragment like the following to your ``*.rst`` file::

       .. [[[cog
       .. from humanfriendly.usage import inject_usage
       .. inject_usage('humanfriendly.cli')
       .. ]]]
       .. [[[end]]]

    The lines in the fragment above are single line reStructuredText_ comments
    that are not copied to the output. Their purpose is to instruct cog_ where
    to inject the reformatted usage message. Once you've added these lines to
    your ``*.rst`` file, updating the rendered usage message becomes really
    simple thanks to cog_:

    .. code-block:: sh

       $ cog.py -r README.rst

    This will inject or replace the rendered usage message in your
    ``README.rst`` file with an up to date copy.
