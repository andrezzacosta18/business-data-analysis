def ansi_style(**kw):
    """
    Generate ANSI escape sequences for the given color and/or style(s).

    :param color: The foreground color. Three types of values are supported:

                  - The name of a color (one of the strings 'black', 'red',
                    'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'magenta', 'cyan' or 'white').
                  - An integer that refers to the 256 color mode palette.
                  - A tuple or list with three integers representing an RGB
                    (red, green, blue) value.

                  The value :data:`None` (the default) means no escape
                  sequence to switch color will be emitted.
    :param background: The background color (see the description
                       of the `color` argument).
    :param bright: Use high intensity colors instead of default colors
                   (a boolean, defaults to :data:`False`).
    :param readline_hints: If :data:`True` then :func:`readline_wrap()` is
                           applied to the generated ANSI escape sequences (the
                           default is :data:`False`).
    :param kw: Any additional keyword arguments are expected to match a key
               in the :data:`ANSI_TEXT_STYLES` dictionary. If the argument's
               value evaluates to :data:`True` the respective style will be
               enabled.
    :returns: The ANSI escape sequences to enable the requested text styles or
              an empty string if no styles were requested.
    :raises: :exc:`~exceptions.ValueError` when an invalid color name is given.

    Even though only eight named colors are supported, the use of `bright=True`
    and `faint=True` increases the number of available colors to around 24 (it
    may be slightly lower, for example because faint black is just black).

    **Support for 8-bit colors**

    In `release 4.7`_ support for 256 color mode was added. While this
    significantly increases the available colors it's not very human friendly
    in usage because you need to look up color codes in the `256 color mode
    palette <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit>`_.

    You can use the ``humanfriendly --demo`` command to get a demonstration of
    the available colors, see also the screen shot below. Note that the small
    font size in the screen shot was so that the demonstration of 256 color
    mode support would fit into a single screen shot without scrolling :-)
    (I wasn't feeling very creative).

      .. image:: images/ansi-demo.png

    **Support for 24-bit colors**

    In `release 4.14`_ support for 24-bit colors was added by accepting a tuple
    or list with three integers representing the RGB (red, green, blue) value
    of a color. This is not included in the demo because rendering millions of
    colors was deemed unpractical ;-).

def clean_terminal_output(text):
    """
    Clean up the terminal output of a command.

    :param text: The raw text with special characters (a Unicode string).
    :returns: A list of Unicode strings (one for each line).

    This function emulates the effect of backspace (0x08), carriage return
    (0x0D) and line feed (0x0A) characters and the ANSI 'erase line' escape
    sequence on interactive terminals. It's intended to clean up command output
    that was originally meant to be rendered on an interactive terminal and
    that has been captured using e.g. the :man:`script` program [#]_ or the
    :mod:`pty` module [#]_.

    .. [#] My coloredlogs_ package supports the ``coloredlogs --to-html``
           command which uses :man:`script` to fool a subprocess into thinking
           that it's connected to an interactive terminal (in order to get it
           to emit ANSI escape sequences).

    .. [#] My capturer_ package uses the :mod:`pty` module to fool the current
           process and subprocesses into thinking they are connected to an
           interactive terminal (in order to get them to emit ANSI escape
           sequences).

    **Some caveats about the use of this function:**

    - Strictly speaking the effect of carriage returns cannot be emulated
      outside of an actual terminal due to the interaction between overlapping
      output, terminal widths and line wrapping. The goal of this function is
      to sanitize noise in terminal output while preserving useful output.
      Think of it as a useful and pragmatic but possibly lossy conversion.

    - The algorithm isn't smart enough to properly handle a pair of ANSI escape
      sequences that open before a carriage return and close after the last
      carriage return in a linefeed delimited string; the resulting string will
      contain only the closing end of the ANSI escape sequence pair. Tracking
      this kind of complexity requires a state machine and proper parsing.

    1. On Windows, if :func:`have_windows_native_ansi_support()` confirms
       native support for ANSI escape sequences :mod:`ctypes` will be used to
       enable this support.

    2. On Windows, if the environment variable ``$ANSICON`` is set nothing is
       done because it is assumed that support for ANSI escape sequences has
       already been enabled via `ansicon <https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon>`_.

    3. On Windows, an attempt is made to import and initialize the Python
       package :pypi:`colorama` instead (of course for this to work
       :pypi:`colorama` has to be installed).

    4. On other platforms this function calls :func:`connected_to_terminal()`
       to determine whether ANSI escape sequences are supported (that is to
       say all platforms that are not Windows are assumed to support ANSI
       escape sequences natively, without weird contortions like above).

    When the selected pager is :man:`less`, the following options are used to

    - ``--quit-if-one-screen`` causes :man:`less` to automatically exit if the
      entire text can be displayed on the first screen. This makes the use of a
      pager transparent for smaller texts (because the operator doesn't have to
      quit the pager).

    - ``--no-init`` prevents :man:`less` from clearing the screen when it

      the next command.
