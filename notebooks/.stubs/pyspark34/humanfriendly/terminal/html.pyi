class HTMLConverter(HTMLParser):
    '''
    Convert HTML with simple text formatting to text with ANSI escape sequences.

    The following text styles are supported:

    - Bold: ``<b>``, ``<strong>`` and ``<span style="font-weight: bold;">``
    - Italic: ``<i>``, ``<em>`` and ``<span style="font-style: italic;">``
    - Strike-through: ``<del>``, ``<s>`` and ``<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">``
    - Underline: ``<ins>``, ``<u>`` and ``<span style="text-decoration: underline">``

    Colors can be specified as follows:

    - Foreground color: ``<span style="color: #RRGGBB;">``
    - Background color: ``<span style="background-color: #RRGGBB;">``

    Here\'s a small demonstration:

    .. code-block:: python

       from humanfriendly.text import dedent
       from humanfriendly.terminal import html_to_ansi

       print(html_to_ansi(dedent(\'\'\'
         <b>Hello world!</b>
         <i>Is this thing on?</i>
         I guess I can <u>underline</u> or <s>strike-through</s> text?
         And what about <span style="color: red">color</span>?
       \'\'\')))

       rainbow_colors = [
           \'#FF0000\', \'#E2571E\', \'#FF7F00\', \'#FFFF00\', \'#00FF00\',
           \'#96BF33\', \'#0000FF\', \'#4B0082\', \'#8B00FF\', \'#FFFFFF\',
       ]
       html_rainbow = "".join(\'<span style="color: %s">o</span>\' % c for c in rainbow_colors)
       print(html_to_ansi("Let\'s try a rainbow: %s" % html_rainbow))

    Here\'s what the results look like:

      .. image:: images/html-to-ansi.png

    Some more details:

    - Nested tags are supported, within reasonable limits.

    - Text in ``<code>`` and ``<pre>`` tags will be highlighted in a
      different color from the main text (currently this is yellow).

    - ``<a href="URL">TEXT</a>`` is converted to the format "TEXT (URL)" where
      the uppercase symbols are highlighted in light blue with an underline.

    - ``<div>``, ``<p>`` and ``<pre>`` tags are considered block level tags
      and are wrapped in vertical whitespace to prevent their content from
      "running into" surrounding text. This may cause runs of multiple empty
      lines to be emitted. As a *workaround* the :func:`__call__()` method
      will automatically call :func:`.compact_empty_lines()` on the generated
      output before returning it to the caller. Of course this won\'t work
      when `output` is set to something like :data:`sys.stdout`.

    - ``<br>`` is converted to a single plain text line break.

    Implementation notes:

    - A list of dictionaries with style information is used as a stack where
      new styling can be pushed and a pop will restore the previous styling.
      When new styling is pushed, it is merged with (but overrides) the current
      styling.

    - If you\'re going to be converting a lot of HTML it might be useful from
      a performance standpoint to re-use an existing :class:`HTMLConverter`
      object for unrelated HTML fragments, in this case take a look at the
      :func:`__call__()` method (it makes this use case very easy).

    .. versionadded:: 4.15
       :class:`humanfriendly.terminal.HTMLConverter` was added to the
       `humanfriendly` package during the initial development of my new
       `chat-archive <https://chat-archive.readthedocs.io/>`_ project, whose
       command line interface makes for a great demonstration of the
       flexibility that this feature provides (hint: check out how the search
       keyword highlighting combines with the regular highlighting).
