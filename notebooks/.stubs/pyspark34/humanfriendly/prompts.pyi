    Prompt the user for confirmation.

    :param question: The text that explains what the user is confirming (a string).
    :param default: The default value (a boolean) or :data:`None`.
    :param padding: Refer to the documentation of :func:`prompt_for_input()`.
    :returns: - If the user enters \'yes\' or \'y\' then :data:`True` is returned.
              - If the user enters \'no\' or \'n\' then :data:`False`  is returned.
              - If the user doesn\'t enter any text or standard input is not
                connected to a terminal (which makes it impossible to prompt
                the user) the value of the keyword argument ``default`` is
                returned (if that value is not :data:`None`).
    :raises: - Any exceptions raised by :func:`retry_limit()`.
             - Any exceptions raised by :func:`prompt_for_input()`.

    When `default` is :data:`False` and the user doesn\'t enter any text an
    error message is printed and the prompt is repeated:

     <BLANKLINE>
     Error: Please enter \'yes\' or \'no\' (there\'s no default choice).

     Are you sure? [y/n]

    The same thing happens when the user enters text that isn\'t recognized:

    >>> prompt_for_confirmation("Are you sure?")
     <BLANKLINE>
     Are you sure? [y/n] about what?
     <BLANKLINE>
     Error: Please enter \'yes\' or \'no\' (the text \'about what?\' is not recognized).
     <BLANKLINE>
     Are you sure? [y/n]

    Prompt the user to select a choice from a group of options.

    :param choices: A sequence of strings with available options.
    :param default: The default choice if the user simply presses Enter
                    (expected to be a string, defaults to :data:`None`).
    :param padding: Refer to the documentation of
                    :func:`~humanfriendly.prompts.prompt_for_input()`.

        raise ValueError("Can\'t prompt for choice without any options!")
    ValueError: Can\'t prompt for choice without any options!

    If a single option is given the user isn\'t prompted:

    >>> prompt_for_choice([\'only one choice\'])
    \'only one choice\'

    Here\'s what the actual prompt looks like by default:

    >>> prompt_for_choice([\'first option\', \'second option\'])
    <BLANKLINE>
      1. first option
      2. second option
    <BLANKLINE>
     Enter your choice as a number or unique substring (Control-C aborts): second
    <BLANKLINE>
    \'second option\'

    If you don\'t like the whitespace (empty lines and indentation):

    >>> prompt_for_choice([\'first option\', \'second option\'], padding=False)
     1. first option
     2. second option
    Enter your choice as a number or unique substring (Control-C aborts): first
    \'first option\'

    of performing the action you would expect them to. By simply importing the
