    Decorator/context manager to capture checkin events for a monitor.

    Usage (as decorator):
    ```
    import sentry_sdk

    app = Celery()

    @app.task
    @sentry_sdk.monitor(monitor_slug='my-fancy-slug')
    def test(arg):
        print(arg)
    ```

    This does not have to be used with Celery, but if you do use it with celery,
    put the `@sentry_sdk.monitor` decorator below Celery's `@app.task` decorator.

    Usage (as context manager):
    ```
    import sentry_sdk

    def test(arg):
        with sentry_sdk.monitor(monitor_slug='my-fancy-slug'):
            print(arg)
    ```
