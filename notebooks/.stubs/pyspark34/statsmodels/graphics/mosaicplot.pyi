    """Create a mosaic plot from a contingency table.

    It allows to visualize multivariate categorical data in a rigorous
    and informative way.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : {dict, Series, ndarray, DataFrame}
        The contingency table that contains the data.
        Each category should contain a non-negative number
        with a tuple as index.  It expects that all the combination
        of keys to be represents; if that is not true, will
        automatically consider the missing values as 0.  The order
        of the keys will be the same as the one of insertion.
        If a dict of a Series (or any other dict like object)
        is used, it will take the keys as labels.  If a
        np.ndarray is provided, it will generate a simple
        numerical labels.
    index : list, optional
        Gives the preferred order for the category ordering. If not specified
        will default to the given order.  It does not support named indexes
        for hierarchical Series.  If a DataFrame is provided, it expects
        a list with the name of the columns.
    ax : Axes, optional
        The graph where display the mosaic. If not given, will
        create a new figure
    horizontal : bool, optional
        The starting direction of the split (by default along
        the horizontal axis)
    gap : {float, sequence[float]}
        The list of gaps to be applied on each subdivision.
        If the length of the given array is less of the number
        of subcategories (or if it's a single number) it will extend
        it with exponentially decreasing gaps
    properties : dict[str, callable], optional
        A function that for each tile in the mosaic take the key
        of the tile and returns the dictionary of properties
        of the generated Rectangle, like color, hatch or similar.
        A default properties set will be provided fot the keys whose
        color has not been defined, and will use color variation to help
        visually separates the various categories. It should return None
        to indicate that it should use the default property for the tile.
        A dictionary of the properties for each key can be passed,
        and it will be internally converted to the correct function
    labelizer : dict[str, callable], optional
        A function that generate the text to display at the center of
        each tile base on the key of that tile
    title : str, optional
        The title of the axis
    statistic : bool, optional
        If true will use a crude statistical model to give colors to the plot.
        If the tile has a constraint that is more than 2 standard deviation
        from the expected value under independence hypothesis, it will
        go from green to red (for positive deviations, blue otherwise) and
        will acquire an hatching when crosses the 3 sigma.
    axes_label : bool, optional
        Show the name of each value of each category
        on the axis (default) or hide them.
    label_rotation : {float, list[float]}
        The rotation of the axis label (if present). If a list is given
        each axis can have a different rotation

    Returns
    -------
    fig : Figure
        The figure containing the plot.
    rects : dict
        A dictionary that has the same keys of the original
        dataset, that holds a reference to the coordinates of the
        tile and the Rectangle that represent it.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot import mosaic

    The most simple use case is to take a dictionary and plot the result

    >>> data = {'a': 10, 'b': 15, 'c': 16}
    >>> mosaic(data, title='basic dictionary')
    >>> plt.show()

    A more useful example is given by a dictionary with multiple indices.
    In this case we use a wider gap to a better visual separation of the
    resulting plot

    >>> data = {('a', 'b'): 1, ('a', 'c'): 2, ('d', 'b'): 3, ('d', 'c'): 4}
    >>> mosaic(data, gap=0.05, title='complete dictionary')
    >>> plt.show()

    The same data can be given as a simple or hierarchical indexed Series

    >>> rand = np.random.random
    >>> from itertools import product
    >>> tuples = list(product(['bar', 'baz', 'foo', 'qux'], ['one', 'two']))
    >>> index = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(tuples, names=['first', 'second'])
    >>> data = pd.Series(rand(8), index=index)
    >>> mosaic(data, title='hierarchical index series')
    >>> plt.show()

    The third accepted data structure is the np array, for which a
    very simple index will be created.

    >>> rand = np.random.random
    >>> data = 1+rand((2,2))
    >>> mosaic(data, title='random non-labeled array')
    >>> plt.show()

    If you need to modify the labeling and the coloring you can give
    a function tocreate the labels and one with the graphical properties
    starting from the key tuple

    >>> data = {'a': 10, 'b': 15, 'c': 16}
    >>> props = lambda key: {'color': 'r' if 'a' in key else 'gray'}
    >>> labelizer = lambda k: {('a',): 'first', ('b',): 'second',
    ...                        ('c',): 'third'}[k]
    >>> mosaic(data, title='colored dictionary', properties=props,
    ...        labelizer=labelizer)
    >>> plt.show()

    Using a DataFrame as source, specifying the name of the columns of interest

    >>> gender = ['male', 'male', 'male', 'female', 'female', 'female']
    >>> pet = ['cat', 'dog', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat']
    >>> data = pd.DataFrame({'gender': gender, 'pet': pet})
    >>> mosaic(data, ['pet', 'gender'], title='DataFrame as Source')
    >>> plt.show()
