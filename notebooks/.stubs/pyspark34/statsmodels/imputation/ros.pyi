def cohn_numbers(df, observations, censorship):
    """
    Computes the Cohn numbers for the detection limits in the dataset.

    The Cohn Numbers are:

        - :math:`A_j =` the number of uncensored obs above the jth
          threshold.
        - :math:`B_j =` the number of observations (cen & uncen) below
          the jth threshold.
        - :math:`C_j =` the number of censored observations at the jth
          threshold.
        - :math:`\\mathrm{PE}_j =` the probability of exceeding the jth
          threshold
        - :math:`\\mathrm{DL}_j =` the unique, sorted detection limits
        - :math:`\\mathrm{DL}_{j+1} = \\mathrm{DL}_j` shifted down a
          single index (row)

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataframe : DataFrame

    observations : str
        Name of the column in the dataframe that contains observed
        values. Censored values should be set to the detection (upper)
        limit.

    censorship : str
        Name of the column in the dataframe that indicates that a
        observation is left-censored. (i.e., True -> censored,
        False -> uncensored)

    Returns
    -------
    cohn : DataFrame
    """
def plotting_positions(df, censorship, cohn):
    """
    Compute the plotting positions for the observations.

    The ROS-specific plotting postions are based on the observations'
    rank, censorship status, and corresponding detection limit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : DataFrame

    censorship : str
        Name of the column in the dataframe that indicates that a
        observation is left-censored. (i.e., True -> censored,
        False -> uncensored)

    cohn : DataFrame
        DataFrame of Cohn numbers.

    Returns
    -------
    plotting_position : array of float

    """
    Impute censored dataset using Regression on Order Statistics (ROS).

    Method described in *Nondetects and Data Analysis* by Dennis R.
    Helsel (John Wiley, 2005) to estimate the left-censored (non-detect)
    values of a dataset. When there is insufficient non-censorded data,
    simple substitution is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    observations : str or array-like
        Label of the column or the float array of censored observations

    censorship : str
        Label of the column or the bool array of the censorship
        status of the observations.

          * True if censored,
          * False if uncensored

    df : DataFrame, optional
        If `observations` and `censorship` are labels, this is the
        DataFrame that contains those columns.

    min_uncensored : int (default is 2)
        The minimum number of uncensored values required before ROS
        can be used to impute the censored observations. When this
        criterion is not met, simple substituion is used instead.

    max_fraction_censored : float (default is 0.8)
        The maximum fraction of censored data below which ROS can be
        used to impute the censored observations. When this fraction is
        exceeded, simple substituion is used instead.

    substitution_fraction : float (default is 0.5)
        The fraction of the detection limit to be used during simple
        substitution of the censored values.

    transform_in : callable (default is np.log)
        Transformation to be applied to the values prior to fitting a
        line to the plotting positions vs. uncensored values.

    transform_out : callable (default is np.exp)
        Transformation to be applied to the imputed censored values
        estimated from the previously computed best-fit line.

    as_array : bool (default is True)
        When True, a numpy array of the imputed observations is
        returned. Otherwise, a modified copy of the original dataframe
        with all of the intermediate calculations is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    imputed : {ndarray, DataFrame}
        The final observations where the censored values have either been
        imputed through ROS or substituted as a fraction of the
        detection limit.

    Notes
    -----
    This function requires pandas 0.14 or more recent.
