        This does not actually do any processing on the data, just stores

        Args:
            data (:term:`bytes-like object`):
                The new data that was just received.

                Special case: If *data* is an empty byte-string like ``b""``,
                then this indicates that the remote side has closed the
                connection (end of file). Normally this is convenient, because
                standard Python APIs like :meth:`file.read` or
                :meth:`socket.recv` use ``b""`` to indicate end-of-file, while
                other failures to read are indicated using other mechanisms
                like raising :exc:`TimeoutError`. When using such an API you
                can just blindly pass through whatever you get from ``read``
                to :meth:`receive_data`, and everything will work.

                But, if you have an API where reading an empty string is a
                valid non-EOF condition, then you need to be aware of this and
                make sure to check for such strings and avoid passing them to
                :meth:`receive_data`.

        Returns:
            Nothing, but after calling this you should call :meth:`next_event`
            to parse the newly received data.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError:
                Raised if you pass an empty *data*, indicating EOF, and then
                pass a non-empty *data*, indicating more data that somehow
                arrived after the EOF.

                (Calling ``receive_data(b"")`` multiple times is fine,
                and equivalent to calling it once.)

               any more events.

            3) The special constant :data:`PAUSED`, which indicates that we
               are not in a state where we can process incoming data (usually
               because the peer has finished their part of the current
               request/response cycle, and you have not yet called
               :meth:`start_next_cycle`). See :ref:`flow-control` for details.

        Raises:
            RemoteProtocolError:
                The peer has misbehaved. You should close the connection
                (possibly after sending some kind of 4xx response).
