class LazyTensorCreator:
    """Lazy auto-converting wrapper for a callable that returns a `tf.Tensor`.

    This class wraps an arbitrary callable that returns a `Tensor` so that it
    will be automatically converted to a `Tensor` by any logic that calls
    `tf.convert_to_tensor()`. This also memoizes the callable so that it is
    called at most once.

    The intended use of this class is to defer the construction of a `Tensor`
    (e.g. to avoid unnecessary wasted computation, or ensure any new ops are
    created in a context only available later on in execution), while remaining
    compatible with APIs that expect to be given an already materialized value
    that can be converted to a `Tensor`.

    This class is thread-safe.
