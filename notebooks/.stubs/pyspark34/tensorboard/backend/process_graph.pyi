    For now, it supports filtering out attributes that are
    too large to be shown in the graph UI.

    Args:
      graph: The GraphDef proto message.
      limit_attr_size: Maximum allowed size in bytes, before the attribute
          is considered large. Default is 1024 (1KB). Must be > 0 or None.
          If None, there will be no filtering.
      large_attrs_key: The attribute key that will be used for storing attributes
          that are too large. Default is '_too_large_attrs'. Must be != None if
          `limit_attr_size` is != None.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If `large_attrs_key is None` while `limit_attr_size != None`.
      ValueError: If `limit_attr_size` is defined, but <= 0.
