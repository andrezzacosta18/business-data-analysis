class Reservoir:
    """A map-to-arrays container, with deterministic Reservoir Sampling.

    Items are added with an associated key. Items may be retrieved by key, and
    a list of keys can also be retrieved. If size is not zero, then it dictates
    the maximum number of items that will be stored with each key. Once there are
    more items for a given key, they are replaced via reservoir sampling, such
    that each item has an equal probability of being included in the sample.

    Deterministic means that for any given seed and bucket size, the sequence of
    values that are kept for any given tag will always be the same, and that this
    is independent of any insertions on other tags. That is:

    >>> separate_reservoir = reservoir.Reservoir(10)
    >>> interleaved_reservoir = reservoir.Reservoir(10)
    >>> for i in range(100):
    >>>   separate_reservoir.AddItem('key1', i)
    >>> for i in range(100):
    >>>   separate_reservoir.AddItem('key2', i)
    >>> for i in range(100):
    >>>   interleaved_reservoir.AddItem('key1', i)
    >>>   interleaved_reservoir.AddItem('key2', i)

    separate_reservoir and interleaved_reservoir will be in identical states.

    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling

    Adding items has amortized O(1) runtime.

    Fields:
      always_keep_last: Whether the latest seen sample is always at the
        end of the reservoir. Defaults to True.
      size: An integer of the maximum number of samples.
