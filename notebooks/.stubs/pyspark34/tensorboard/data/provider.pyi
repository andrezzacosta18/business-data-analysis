class DataProvider(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    '''Interface for reading TensorBoard scalar, tensor, and blob data.

    These APIs are under development and subject to change. For instance,
    providers may be asked to implement more filtering mechanisms, such as
    downsampling strategies or domain restriction by step or wall time.

    The data provider interface specifies three *data classes*: scalars,
    tensors, and blob sequences. All data is stored in *time series* for
    one of these data classes. A time series is identified by run name and
    tag name (each a non-empty text string), as well as an experiment ID
    and plugin name (see below). Points in a time series are uniquely
    indexed by *step*, an arbitrary non-negative integer. Each point in a
    time series also has an associated wall time, plus its actual value,
    which is drawn from the corresponding data class.

    Each point in a scalar time series contains a single scalar value, as
    a 64-bit floating point number. Scalars are "privileged" rather than
    being subsumed under tensors because there are useful operations on
    scalars that don\'t make sense in the general tensor case: e.g., "list
    all scalar time series with tag name `accuracy` whose exponentially
    weighted moving average is at least 0.999".

    Each point in a tensor time series contains a tensor of arbitrary
    dtype (including byte strings and text strings) and shape (including
    rank-0 tensors, a.k.a. scalars). Each tensor is expected to be
    "reasonably small" to accommodate common database cell size limits.
    For instance, a histogram with a bounded number of buckets (say, 30)
    occupies about 500 bytes, and a PR curve with a bounded number of
    thresholds (say, 201) occupies about 5000 bytes. These are both well
    within typical database tolerances (Google Cloud Spanner: 10 MiB;
    MySQL: 64 KiB), and would be appropriate to store as tensors. By
    contrast, image, audio, or model graph data may easily be multiple
    megabytes in size, and so should be stored as blobs instead. The
    tensors at each step in a time series need not have the same dtype or
    shape.

    Each point in a blob sequence time series contains an ordered sequence
    of zero or more blobs, which are arbitrary data with no tensor
    structure. These might represent PNG-encoded image data, protobuf wire
    encodings of TensorFlow graphs, or PLY-format 3D mesh data, for some
    examples. This data class provides blob *sequences* rather than just
    blobs because it\'s common to want to take multiple homogeneous samples
    of a given time series: say, "show me the bounding box classifications
    for 3 random inputs from this batch". A single blob can of course be
    represented as a blob sequence that always has exactly one element.

    When reading time series, *downsampling* refers to selecting a
    subset of the points in each time series. Downsampling only occurs
    across the step axis (rather than, e.g., the blobs in a single blob
    sequence datum), and occurs individually within each time series.
    When downsampling, the latest datum should always be included in the
    sample, so that clients have a view of metrics that is maximally up
    to date. Implementations may choose to force the first (oldest)
    datum to be included in each sample as well, but this is not
    required; clients should not make assumptions either way. The
    remainder of the points in the sample should be selected uniformly
    at random from available points. Downsampling should be
    deterministic within a time series. It is also useful for the
    downsampling behavior to depend only on the set of step values
    within a time series, such that two "parallel" time series with data
    at exactly the same steps also retain the same steps after
    downsampling.

    Every time series belongs to a specific experiment and is owned by a
    specific plugin. (Thus, the "primary key" for a time series has four
    components: experiment, plugin, run, tag.) The experiment ID is an
    arbitrary URL-safe non-empty text string, whose interpretation is at
    the discretion of the data provider. As a special case, the empty
    string as an experiment ID denotes that no experiment was given. Data
    providers may or may not fully support an empty experiment ID. The
    plugin name should correspond to the `plugin_data.plugin_name` field
    of the `SummaryMetadata` proto passed to `tf.summary.write`.

    All methods on this class take a `RequestContext` parameter as the
    first positional argument. This argument is temporarily optional to
    facilitate migration, but will be required in the future.

    Unless otherwise noted, any methods on this class may raise errors
    defined in `tensorboard.errors`, like `tensorboard.errors.NotFoundError`.

    If not implemented, optional methods may return `None`.
